Let D be a digraph.  Suppose that u ∈ V(D).  We define W_D(u)={v | (u,v) ≠∞} to be the walkable neighborhood of u with respect to D. If D is clear from context, we simply write W(u).

Also define A_s,D(u)= |N_1(u)| - |N_2(u)| to be the anti-satisfaction of u.  As usual, if G is clear from context, we simply write A_s(v).  Notice that u is satisfactory if and only if A_s(u) ≤ 0.



Again let D be a directed graph.  Recall that a transitive triangle T is a directed graph on three nodes a,b,c such that (a,b), (a,c), (b,c)∈ E(T).  If (u,v) ∈ E(D), we say that edge (u,v) is the base of a transitive triangle if u and v share a common first neighbor; that is, |N_1(u)∩ N_1(v)| ≥ 1.

	A threshold graph is a graph that is constructed inductively from K_1 by successively adding either an isolated vertex or a dominating vertex.  We think of the vertex set of a threshold graph on n vertices as [n].  We label the vertices “backwards”, so that vertex n is the initial K_1, vertex n-1 is the first vertex added, and so on.  The code of a threshold graph with n vertices is the binary sequence  of length n-1 such that _i=1 if the vertex i was a dominating vertex when added and _i=0 if it was an isolate.  For a binary sequence ∈0,1^n-1, we let T() denote the threshold graph on [n] with code .  Note that (vertices that correspond to) 1s are adjacent everything to their right and 1s to their left, while 0s are adjacent only to 1s to their left.
	
	We will write an expression such as 1^a0^b1^c… for the sequence consisting of a 1s, b 0s, c 1s, etc.  Also, given sequences  and τ, we write .τ for their concatenation.

Jigsaw percolation with input G evolves at discrete times t=0,1,… according to the following algorithm. At time t there is a partition _t={C_t^1,…,C_t^k_t} of the vertex set [n], which is constructed inductively as follows:


  * We take k_0=n and C_0^i = {i} for all 1≤ i≤ n. That is, at time 0 we begin with every vertex in a separate set of the partition.

  * At time t≥ 0, construct a graph _t on vertex set _t by joining C_t^i to C_t^j if there exist edges e_1∈ E_1 and e_2∈ E_2 such that

    e_ℓ∩ C_t^k ≠∅

corresponding to the connected components of _t, so each part C_t+1^i is a union of those parts of _t corresponding to a component of _t.

  * If |_t+1|=1 then STOP. Otherwise, go to step 2. 

Since |_t| is strictly decreasing, the algorithm terminates in time at most n2. We denote the final partition by _∞=(C_∞^1,…,C_∞^k_∞). We say that there is percolation , or that the double graph is solved , if _∞={V}, i.e., if we stop in step (4).

Let G_1 and G_2 be two vertex disjoint  graphs with Hamiltonian alternating cycles C_1=x_0x_1⋯ x_2n-1x_0 and C_2=y_0 y_1 ⋯ y_2m-1 y_0, respectively; G∈ G_1⊕ G_2 be a c.g.s. with no good pair. For each exterior edge u_0v_0, u_0∈ V(C_1) and v_0∈ V(C_2), we construct a sequence of edges as follows: (i) If u_0v_0 is red (blue), let u_1∈ V(C_1) and v_1∈ V(C_2) such that, u_0u_1∈ E(C_1) is red (blue) and v_0v_1∈ E(C_2) is red (blue).
Since G has no good pair, we have that u_1v_1 is blue (red). Observe that u_0v_0 and u_1v_1 have different colors. (ii) Assume that u_0v_0, u_1v_1, …, u_iv_i have been constructed in such a way that u_0, u_1, …, u_i∈ V(C_1), v_0, v_1, …, v_i∈ V(C_2), c(u_jv_j)≠ c(u_j+1v_j+1), c(u_ju_j+1)=c(v_jv_j+1) for each j, 0≤ j ≤ i-1, and the sequence u_0u_1⋯ u_i (resp. v_0v_1⋯ v_i) is a walk (notice that: when l(C_1)≠ l(C_2) a same vertex can appear more than once in this process) contained in C_1 (resp. C_2) that moves along C_1 (resp. C_2)  in the same direction or in the opposite direction (thus, consecutive edges have different colors). (iii) Now, we construct u_i+1v_i+1. If u_iv_i is red (blue), let u_i+1∈ V(C_1) and v_i+1∈ V(C_2) such that u_iu_i+1∈ E(C_1) is red (blue) and v_iv_i+1∈ E(C_2) is red (blue). Since G has no good pair, we have that u_i+1v_i+1 is blue (red). (iv) The sequence finishes the first time that u_kv_k=u_0v_0. That is when k=(2n,2m). Notice that u_iv_i and u_i+1v_i+1 have different colors (and they are different edges), and thus c(u_iv_i)=c(u_jv_j)  if and only if i≡ j 2 (Figure <ref>). 

The parallel class of u_0v_0 denoted by P_u_0v_0 is the set {u_iv_i | 0≤ i≤ k-1} and two exterior edges e_1, e_2 will be named parallel whenever there exists an exterior edge zw such that e_1, e_2 ∈ P_zw.

Since k=(2n,2m), for each vertex w∈ V(C_i), i∈{1,2}, there exists at least one edge in the parallel class P_u_0v_0 incident with w.

A marking of a floor diagram  is defined by the following
four step process. 

Step 1: For each vertex j of , create s_j new indistinguishable vertices and
connect them to j with new edges directed towards j. 


Step 2: For each vertex j of , create r_j - l_j + s_j- div(j) new indistinguishable vertices and
connect them to j with new edges directed away from j. This makes the divergence of vertex j equal to r_j - l_j for 1 ≤ j ≤ M.


Step 3: Subdivide each edge of the original floor
diagram  into two
directed edges by introducing a new
vertex for each edge. The new edges inherit their weights and orientations. Denote the
resulting graph .

We denote the path from the root to the leaf j by (j). The edge labels are such that ≪(j) = ≪((j)) is S[j,n] and a $ sign at the end. The definition becomes more clear if we check the example on <ref> and <ref>.

A 2 → 1 directed hypergraph is a pair H = (V,E) where V is a finite set of vertices and the set of edges E is some subset of the set of all pointed 3-subsets of V. That is, each edge is three distinct elements of V with one marked as special. This special vertex can be thought of as the head vertex of the edge while the other two make up the tail set of the edge. If H is such that every 3-subset of V contains at most one edge of E, then we call H oriented . For a given H we will typically write its vertex and edge sets as V(H) and E(H). We will write an edge as ab → c when the underlying 3-set is {a,b,c} and the head vertex is c.

 The size of this set, |T_x| will be called the tail degree of x. The degree of a particular vertex y in the tail link graph of x will be denoted d_x(y).

A coupling is Markovian if the probability distribution of (X_t+1,Y_t+1) given history (X_0,Y_0),…,(X_t-1,Y_t-1),(X_t,Y_t) is identical to the probability distribution of (X_t+1,Y_t+1) given history (X_0',Y_0'),…,(X_t-1',Y_t-1'),(X_t,Y_t). In other words, the probability distribution of (X_t+1,Y_t+1) depends only on the previous state (X_t,Y_t).[This is different from a definition provided by Angel et al., where the distribution of X_t+1 depends on (X_t,Y_t) and the distribution of Y_t+1 depends on (X_t+1,Y_t). We will discuss the relationship between the two definitions and the results achieved so far in the next section.] 

A Markovian avoidance coupling on a state space M is a Markov chain on M× M such that for any x,y,z∈ M the stationary probability of (x,x) is 0, and if the stationary probability (x,y) is positive, the transition probability of (x,y)→(y,z) is 0.

This can be extended to k walks as follows. Let the k simple random walks be X^i_t, and the positions of all tokens on the graph at time t be (X^1_t,…,X^k_t). Then the coupling is Markovian if (X^1_t+1,…,X^k_t+1) depends only on (X^1_t,…,X^k_t).

A (parametrized) tropical curve of degree Δ is an
abstract tropical curve C, together with a continuous map h: C →^2 satisfying:


  * (Rational slope) The map h is affine linear on each edge e of C, i.e.,
  h|_e(t) = t· v + a for some non-zero v ∈^2 and a ∈^2. If V is a vertex of the edge e and we parametrize e
  starting at V, then we call v above the direction vector
  of e starting at V, and we write v = v(V, e) ∈^2. The lattice
  length of v(V,e) (i.e, the greatest integral common divisor of
  the entries of v(V, e)) is the weight ω(e) of
  e. We call the integral vector u(V,e) = 1ω(e) v(V,e) the
  primitive direction vector of e.

  of the unbounded edges with primitive direction vector u equals the lattice length of an edge of
  ∂Δ with outer normal vector u (if there is no such
  edge, we require the total weight to be zero).

A Δ-floor diagram  consists of:

  multiple edges, with edges directed i → j if i < j.

  * A sequence (s_1, …, s_d) of non-negative integers such
  that s_1 + ⋯ + s_d =c. (If S = (1,1,m) then all s_i

    div(j) def=∑_[ edges e;  j e→ k ](e) -   ∑_[ edges e;  i e→ j ](e)≤ m + s_j.

A marking of a floor diagram  is defined by the following
four step process

Step 1: 
For each vertex j of  create s_j new indistinguishable vertices and
connect them to j with new edges directed towards j.

Step 2: For each vertex j of  create m+s_j- div(j) new
indistinguishable vertices and connect them to j with new edges
directed away from j. This makes the divergence of vertex j equal
to m.


Step 3: Subdivide each edge of the original floor
diagram  into two
directed edges by introducing a new
vertex for each edge. The new edges inherit their weights and orientations. Denote the
resulting graph .

"Barb, “Playing the Barb"" Strategy Mode

An (s, t)-barb , or simply barb , is a subset = {w,z}⊆ such that w,z form a down-run,  and  are (possibly empty) s- and t-up-runs, respectively, and also x(w) < max_u ∈ x(u) < min_v ∈ x(v) < x(z) and max_u ∈ y(u) < y(z) < y(w) < min_v ∈ y(v).
We say that w and z are the spikes of , that  is the bottom wire of , and that  is the top wire of .
If one of  or  is empty, we drop the appropriate inequality conditions and say that  is a half-barb .
We say that player A plays the barb by doing the following:


  *  Let a := max_p ∈∪{w} x(p) and b := min_p ∈∪{z} x(p).
Play in the column (a,b) with respect to .
Player B chooses a row, creating the new point q.


  * Assuming the game is not over, q is in the row zero notches above w or zero notches below z with respect to .
If the former, add q to ; if the latter, add q to .
Return to Step <ref>.

"“w-Barb"" Strategy Mode

Suppose a game of A_m,3 is underway with the point set = {r_1,q_1}_1 such that _1 = {r_1,q_1}∪_1 is a half-barb with spikes r_1,q_1 (where x(r_1) < x(q_1)) and top wire _1, such that = (r_1), and such that  is an up-run.
Let r̂_1 = _p ∈(q_1)∖{r_1} y(p).
The parameter w is given as a positive integer.
As player A, do the following:


  *  Let i be maximum such that _i has been defined; play in the column (x(r_i),x(r̂_i)).
Player B chooses a row, creating the new point q.
Assuming the game is not over, we have y(q) < y(r̂_i).


  * If q is zero notches above r_i with respect to _i, add q to 𝒱_i, then redefine r̂_i := q and go to Step <ref>.
Otherwise, q is below r_i, say by d notches with respect to .
If d ≥ w - i and d > 0, then go to Step <ref>.
Otherwise, d < w - i or d = 0; go to Step <ref>.


  *  Consider q_i a lost point.
Rename q to be q_i+1, define r_i+1 := _p ∈(q_i+1) y(p), define r̂_i+1 := _p ∈(q_i+1)∖{r_i+1} y(p), define _i+1 : = _i (q_i+1) ∖{ r_i+1}, and define the half-barb _i+1 := {r_i+1,q_i+1}_i+1.
Return to Step <ref>.


  *  Consider (q) as lost points.
Let = (q) ∪{q} and let = {r_i,q_i}∪∪_i.
Then  is a barb with spikes r_i and q_i, top wire _i and bottom wire ; play the barb  until the game finishes.


We illustrate a step of the w-Barb strategy mode in the Appendix.
[One can replace the rules for going to Steps <ref> and <ref> with rules that compare d to |(q)| rather than comparing d to w-i.
This would not improve the result of Lemma <ref>, but would be a better strategy for player A when player B does not play optimally.]

"f-Combined Strategy

Let f be given.

If the former, then let := (p_ℓ) ∩, r_1 := p_ℓ, q_1 := q, _1 := (p_ℓ) ∩. Also add q̂ to _1. Go to Step <ref>.

Given a spread set 𝒮={U_1,…,U_q-1} of nonzero matrices, one forms a (q-1) × (q-1) matrix whose (i,j) entry is 0, +1 or -1 according as (U_i-U_j) is zero, square or nonsquare, respectively. Border this matrix with a leading row and column of 1s (except for the first entry on the diagonal which remains zero) to form a symmetric q× q matrix A with 0 on the diagonal, and ± 1 in every non-diagonal entry. Finally, form the matrix F = AA^t (with the product being taken in the rational numbers). The fingerprint of the spread set is the multiset of the absolute values of the entries of F.

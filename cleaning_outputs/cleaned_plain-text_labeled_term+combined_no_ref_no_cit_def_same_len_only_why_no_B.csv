A~$(\lambda,\rho)$-marking of~$\Dcal$ is a combinatorial decoration

We will illustrate the steps of this procedure using a running

In addition, introduce some (possibly none) edges directed from $v$

Assign positive integer weights to all these new edges, so that
\begin{itemize}
\item
for each original vertex $v$ in~$\Dcal$, 
the total weight of all new edges (of both kinds) originating

\item
the weights of all other new edges form the partition~$\rho$.

Floor diagrams marked by pairs of partitions ]
Let  be a labeled floor diagram of degree d and genus g. 
Let λ and ρ be two partitions with |λ|+|ρ|=d.
A (λ,ρ)-marking of  is a combinatorial decoration
of  obtained by the following modification of the procedure
used in Definition <ref>. 
We will illustrate the steps of this procedure using a running
example, in which d=4, g=1, λ=(2), ρ=(1,1),
and  is the labeled floor diagram from
Example <ref>:

Step 0.
Introduce ℓ(λ) new vertices denoted
v_1,…,v_ℓ(λ):  

    (80,20)(30,-4)(25,1.5)(0,0)2(7,0)(1,0)1(17.5,1.75)(2,-1)1(17.5,-1.75)(2,1)1(27,0)(1,0)1(40,0)2(40,0)*1(42,2)(0,0)v_1


Step 1.
For each original vertex v in , introduce some number (possibly none)
of additional new vertices, and connect v to each of them 
by a single edge directed away from v.
In addition, introduce some (possibly none) edges directed from v
to v_1,…,v_ℓ(λ). 
Assign positive integer weights to all these new edges, so that


  * for each original vertex v in , 
the total weight of all new edges (of both kinds) originating
at v is equal to 1-(v);

  * the weights of all edges arriving at v_1,…,v_ℓ(λ) 

form the partition λ; 

  * the weights of all other new edges form the partition ρ. 
















Thus, the total weight of all new edges is
equal to ∑_v (1-(v))=d=|λ|+|ρ|.

The vertex $v_q^\star$ can be chosen to be the maximal degree vertex among all vertices that are reachable from $v_q$ on a path of length $T_q({\beta_n})$.

-coalgebra homomorphism,"
\label{def.kA-coalg}Let $A$ be a commutative $\mathbf{k}$-algebra.

\textbf{(a)} Let $H$ be a $\mathbf{k}$-module, and let $G$ be an $A$-module.
For any $\mathbf{k}$-linear map $f:H\rightarrow G$, we let $f^{\sharp}$ denote
the $A$-linear map%
\[
\underline{A}\otimes H\rightarrow G,\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ a\otimes h\mapsto
af\left(  h\right)  .
\]
(It is easy to see that this latter map is indeed well-defined and
$A$-linear.) For any $A$-linear map $g:\underline{A}\otimes H\rightarrow G$,
we let $g^{\flat}$ denote the $\mathbf{k}$-linear map%
\[
H\rightarrow G,\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ h\mapsto g\left(  1\otimes h\right)  .
\]


Sometimes we will use the notations $f^{\sharp\left(  A,\mathbf{k}\right)  }$
and $g^{\flat\left(  A,\mathbf{k}\right)  }$ instead of $f^{\sharp}$ and
$g^{\flat}$ when the $A$ and the $\mathbf{k}$ are not clear from the context.

It is easy to see that $\left(  f^{\sharp}\right)  ^{\flat}=f$ for any
$\mathbf{k}$-linear map $f:H\rightarrow G$, and that $\left(  g^{\flat
}\right)  ^{\sharp}=g$ for any $A$-linear map $g:\underline{A}\otimes
H\rightarrow G$. Thus, the maps%
\begin{align}
\left\{  \mathbf{k}\text{-linear maps }H\rightarrow G\right\}   &
\rightarrow\left\{  A\text{-linear maps }\underline{A}\otimes H\rightarrow
G\right\}  ,\nonumber\\
f  &  \mapsto f^{\sharp} \label{eq.def.kA-coalg.dies}%
\end{align}
and%
\begin{align}
\left\{  A\text{-linear maps }\underline{A}\otimes H\rightarrow G\right\}   &
\rightarrow\left\{  \mathbf{k}\text{-linear maps }H\rightarrow G\right\}
,\nonumber\\
g  &  \mapsto g^{\flat} \label{eq.def.kA-coalg.bemol}%
\end{align}
are mutually inverse.

This is a particular case of an adjunction between functors (namely, the
Hom-tensor adjunction, with a slight simplification, also known as the
induction-restriction adjunction); this is also the reason why we are using
the $\sharp$ and $\flat$ notations. The maps (\ref{eq.def.kA-coalg.dies}) and
(\ref{eq.def.kA-coalg.bemol}) are natural in $H$ and $G$.

\textbf{(b)} Let $H$ be a $\mathbf{k}$-coalgebra, and let $G$ be an
$A$-coalgebra. A $\mathbf{k}$-linear map $f:H\rightarrow G$ is said to be a
$\left(  \mathbf{k},\underline{A}\right)  $\textit{-coalgebra homomorphism} if

Let A be a commutative 𝐤-algebra.

(a) Let H be a 𝐤-module, and let G be an A-module.
For any 𝐤-linear map f:H→ G, we let f^♯ denote
the A-linear map

    A⊗ H→ G,          a⊗ h↦
    af(  h)  .

(It is easy to see that this latter map is indeed well-defined and
A-linear.) For any A-linear map g:A⊗ H→ G,
we let g^♭ denote the 𝐤-linear map

    H→ G,          h↦ g(  1⊗ h)  .



Sometimes we will use the notations f^♯(  A,𝐤)
and g^♭(  A,𝐤) instead of f^♯ and
g^♭ when the A and the 𝐤 are not clear from the context.

It is easy to see that (  f^♯)  ^♭=f for any
𝐤-linear map f:H→ G, and that (  g^♭)  ^♯=g for any A-linear map g:A⊗
H→ G. Thus, the maps

    {𝐤-linear maps H→ G}   →{  A-linear maps A⊗ H→
    G}  ,
    
    f     ↦ f^♯

and

    {  A-linear maps A⊗ H→ G}   →{𝐤-linear maps H→ G}
    ,
    
    g     ↦ g^♭

are mutually inverse.

This is a particular case of an adjunction between functors (namely, the
Hom-tensor adjunction, with a slight simplification, also known as the
induction-restriction adjunction); this is also the reason why we are using
the ♯ and ♭ notations. The maps (<ref>) and
(<ref>) are natural in H and G.

(b) Let H be a 𝐤-coalgebra, and let G be an
A-coalgebra. A 𝐤-linear map f:H→ G is said to be a
(  𝐤,A)-coalgebra homomorphism if
the A-linear map f^♯:A⊗ H→ G is an

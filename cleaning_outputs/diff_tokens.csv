36,non-empty;for sufficiently fine $\alpha$;tends to $c_\infty$ as $\alpha \to \infty$,"[Colouring topology]\label{color-top}  Let $Z$ be a sub-Cantor palette of order at most $k$.  For each $0 \leq j \leq k$, we let $\Col_j(Z)$ denote the collection of all finite $\sigma$-algebras $\B$ of $Z_j$ that are generated by clopen sets, and let $\Col(Z) := \prod_{j=0}^k \Col_j(Z)$.  Note that every colouring $\alpha = (\alpha_j)_{j=0}^\infty: Z \to A$ generates an element $\B_\alpha = (\B_{\alpha_j})_{j=0}^k$ of $\Col(Z)$, where $\B_{\alpha_j}$ is the $\sigma$-algebra of $Z_j$ is generated by the level sets of $\alpha_j: Z_j \to A_j$.  (The maps $\alpha_j$ for $j>k$ are trivial and thus of no consequence.)

We endow $\Col(Z)$ with the topology whose sub-basic open sets take the form
\begin{equation}\label{sub-basic}
\{ (\B_j)_{j=0}^k \in \Col(Z): \B_i \supset F( \B_{i+1},\ldots, \B_k ) \}
\end{equation}
where $0 \leq i \leq k$ and $F: \Col_{i+1}(Z) \times \ldots \times \Col_k(Z) \to \Col_i(Z)$ is an arbitrary function.  Thus a set is open if it is the union of sets which are finite intersections of sets of the form \eqref{sub-basic}.  We make the simple but important observation that the intersection of finitely many non-empty open sets in $\Col(Z)$ is again a \emph{non-empty} open set.

Let $\alpha: Z \to A$ be a colouring.  A statement involving $\alpha$ is said to hold \emph{for sufficiently fine $\alpha$} if there exists a non-empty open set $U \subset \Col(Z)$ such that the statement holds whenever $\B_\alpha \in U$.  If $c(\alpha) \in \R$ is a real-valued quantity depending\footnote{Technically, the class of all colourings on a given palette $Z$ is not a set, so that $c$ here is a class function rather than a function, but one can rectify this by any number of artificial expedients, for instance by forcing all palettes to take values in the set of integers.} on $\alpha$, and $c_\infty$ is a real number, we say that $c(\alpha)$ \emph{tends to $c_\infty$ as $\alpha \to \infty$} , and write $\lim_{\alpha \to \infty} c(\alpha) = c_\infty$ or $c(\alpha) = c_\infty + o_{\alpha \to \infty}(1)$, if for every $\eps > 0$, the statement $|c(\alpha) - c_\infty| \leq \eps$ is true for sufficiently fine $\alpha$.

Note that the vertex disk structure of the ribbon graph is changed by the operation of partial duality.

We say that a block $w=w_1\ldots w_k\in\Al^*$ \emph{dominates} a block $v=v_1\ldots v_k\in\Al^*$ if $v_i\le w_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,k$. In an analogous way we define when one sequence from $\Al^\N$ dominates another.

A \emph{subordinate of $\mathcal{L}\subset \Al^*$} is the set $\mathcal{L}^\le$ of all blocks over $\Al$ that are dominated by some block in $\mathcal{L}$.

\label{def.sst}Let $\mu$ and $\lambda$ be two partitions such that
$\mu\subseteq\lambda$. Define the set $Y\left(  \lambda/\mu\right)  $ as in
Example \ref{exam.dp}. A \textit{semistandard tableau of shape }$\lambda/\mu$
means a map $\phi:Y\left(  \lambda/\mu\right)  \rightarrow\left\{
1,2,3,\ldots\right\}  $ satisfying the following two assertions:

\textit{Assertion }$\mathcal{T}_{1}$: For any $\left(  i,a\right)  \in
Y\left(  \lambda/\mu\right)  $ and $\left(  i,b\right)  \in Y\left(
\lambda/\mu\right)  $ with $a<b$, we have $\phi\left(  i,a\right)  \leq
\phi\left(  i,b\right)  $.

\textit{Assertion }$\mathcal{T}_{2}$: For any $\left(  a,j\right)  \in

\lambda/\mu\right)  $ with $a<b$, we have $\phi\left(  a,j\right)
<\phi\left(  b,j\right)  $.

(It is usual to visualize the set $Y\left(  \lambda/\mu\right)  $ as a set of
$1\times1$-squares on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$; then, a map
$\phi:Y\left(  \lambda/\mu\right)  \rightarrow\left\{  1,2,3,\ldots\right\}  $
can be regarded as a filling of these squares with numbers in $\left\{
1,2,3,\ldots\right\}  $. In this visual representation, Assertion
$\mathcal{T}_{1}$ claims that the entries of the filling $\phi$ are weakly
increasing from left to right along each row of the tableau, whereas Assertion
$\mathcal{T}_{2}$ says that the entries of $\phi$ are strictly increasing from
top to bottom along each column of the tableau. See \cite[\S 2.2]{Reiner} for
more about semistandard tableaux (which are called column-strict tableaux in

2463,disjoint union;canonical inclusion of the ,"
\label{def.djun.sets}Let $I$ be a set. For each $i\in I$, let $E_{i}$ be a
set. Then, we define a set $\bigsqcup_{i\in I}E_{i}$ by%
\[
\bigsqcup_{i\in I}E_{i}=\bigcup_{i\in I}\left(  \left\{  i\right\}  \times
E_{i}\right)  .
\]
(Notice that the sets $\left\{  i\right\}  \times E_{i}$ for distinct $i\in I$
are disjoint.) The set $\bigsqcup_{i\in I}E_{i}$ is called the
\textit{disjoint union} of the sets $E_{i}$. Thus, an element of this disjoint
union $\bigsqcup_{i\in I}E_{i}$ is a pair $\left(  i,e\right)  $, where $i$ is
an element of $I$ and where $e$ is an element of $E_{i}$.

For each $j\in I$, we let $\operatorname*{inc}\nolimits_{j}$ be the map%
\[
E_{j}\rightarrow\bigsqcup_{i\in I}E_{i},\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ e\mapsto\left(
j,e\right)  .
\]
This map $\operatorname*{inc}\nolimits_{j}$ is injective, and satisfies
$\operatorname*{inc}\nolimits_{j}\left(  E_{j}\right)  =\left\{  j\right\}
\times E_{j}$. This map $\operatorname*{inc}\nolimits_{j}$ is called the
\textit{canonical inclusion of the }$j$\textit{-th term into the disjoint
union }$\bigsqcup_{i\in I}E_{i}$.

When the sets $E_{i}$ are disjoint, their disjoint union $\bigsqcup_{i\in
I}E_{i}$ is often identified with their union $\bigcup_{i\in I}E_{i}$ via the
bijection%
\begin{equation}
\bigsqcup_{i\in I}E_{i}\rightarrow\bigcup_{i\in I}E_{i}%

We shall not make this identification, however.

When the sets $E_{i}$ are not disjoint, the map
(\ref{eq.def.djun.sets.identif}) is no longer a bijection (but just a
surjection), and thus our above definition of $\bigsqcup_{i\in I}E_{i}$ really
is the simplest way to define a \textquotedblleft disjoint
union\textquotedblright\ of these sets $E_{i}$ (i.e., a big set into which
each $E_{i}$ is canonically embedded in such a way that all the embeddings
have disjoint images).

(Notice that the sets {  i}× E_i for distinct i∈ I
are disjoint.) The set _i∈ IE_i is called the
disjoint union of the sets E_i. Thus, an element of this disjoint
union _i∈ IE_i is a pair (  i,e), where i is
an element of I and where e is an element of E_i.

For each j∈ I, we let *inc_j be the map

    E_j→_i∈ IE_i,          e↦(

This map *inc_j is injective, and satisfies
*inc_j(  E_j)  ={  j}× E_j. This map *inc_j is called the
canonical inclusion of the j-th term into the disjoint

such that the following conditions are satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
\item %[(a)]
\emph{(Genus)}
The edge set $E$ consists of $d+g-1$ edges.
Equivalently, 
%the rank of the first homology group 
the first Betti number of~$G$ is equal
to~$g$, assuming that $G$ is stripped of orientation and viewed as a

Each edge in $E$ is directed from a vertex $u$ to a vertex $v>u$.
Thus $G$ is acyclic, and in particular has no loops.
Multiple edges are allowed.

In this section, we only consider strings containing at least one {\fsds}. Let $\delta({x})$ denote the number of \fsds{s} in $x$.
We  prove by induction that $\delta({x})\leq \frac{7}{8}|x|\-\frac{3}{8}|u|$  where $u$ is the generator of the shorter square of the 
first \fsds\ in $x$. 
We first need to investigate the relationship between two \fsds{s} of $x$ as the induction hypothesis is 
applied to the substring starting at some \fsds\ and extended to the
string starting with the first \fsds. 

\begin{lemma}
\label{GapTail}
Let $x$ be a string starting with an \fsds\ $\cal U$ and let $\cal V$ be another \fsds\ of $x$ with $\send{u_{[1]}}\leq\send{v_{[1]}}$. 
Let $x'$ be the suffix of $x$ starting at the same position as $\cal V$.
Let $d$ be the number of \fsds{s} 
between $\cal U$ and $\cal V$ including $\cal U$ but not including $\cal V$. 
Then, $\delta({x'})\leq \frac{5}{6}|x'|\-\frac{1}{3}|v|$ implies $\delta({x})\leq \frac{5}{6}|x|\-\frac{1}{3}|u|\+d\-\frac{1}{2}|G({\cal U},{\cal V})|\-\frac{1}{3}|T({\cal U},{\cal V})|$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\onehalfspacing
As $|G|\+|v|=|u|\+|T|$, we have $\-\frac{1}{3}|v|=\-\frac{1}{3}|u|\-\frac{1}{3}|T|\+\frac{1}{3}|G|$.
Thus, $\delta({x})\leq d\+\delta({x'})\leq d\+\frac{5}{6}|x'|\-\frac{1}{3}|v|=
d\+\frac{5}{6}|x'|\-\frac{1}{3}|u|\-\frac{1}{3}|T|\+\frac{1}{3}|G|$. 
Thus, $\delta({x})\leq \frac{5}{6}(|x'|\+|G|)\-\frac{1}{3}|u| \+d\-\frac{5}{6}|G|\+\frac{1}{3}|G|\-\frac{1}{3}|T|
=\frac{5}{6}|x|\-\frac{1}{3}|u| \+d\-\frac{1}{2}|G|\-\frac{1}{3}|T|$ since\linebreak
$|x|=|x'|\+|G|$.
\end{proof}

Lemma~\ref{GapTail} yields a straightforward induction step whenever $\frac{1}{2}|G|\+\frac{1}{3}|T|\geq d$. 
By Lemma~\ref{vv-cases}, this condition always holds except for the two cases: either ${\cal V}$ is a right cyclic shift of $\cal U$ by 1 position and hence an \amate\ of ${\cal U}$, since then $\frac{1}{2}|G|\+\frac{1}{3}|T|=
\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}=\frac{5}{6}\ne 1$, or 
${\cal V}$ is a \bmate\ of ${\cal U}$ and such that 
$\send{v_{[1]}}<\send{u_{[1]}}$ -- hence Lemma~\ref{GapTail} is not
applicable. Therefore the whole
group of \amate{s} and \bmate{s} of $\cal U$ must be dealt together in the
induction
rather than carrying it from one \fsds\ to another. Since a \gmate\ of $\cal U$
does not provide a sufficiently large tail to offset all of the \amate{s} and
\bmate{s} of $\cal U$ preceding it, we have to include them in the special treatment as
well -- this is all precisely defined and explained in Section~\ref{abg}.
First we need to strengthens the bound on the length of the maximal right
cyclic shift of $\cal U$ when $\p{U}=\q{U}$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{rot1}
Let $x$ be a string starting with an \fsds\ ${\cal U}$  such that $\p{U}=\q{U}$,
i.e. $x$ = $U^2y$ for some, possibly empty, $y$, then 
$lcp(u,y)<min\{|y|,|u_2|\}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Lemma~\ref{rot1} trivially holds if $|y|\leq |u_2|$. Let us assume $|y|> |u_2|$ and 
$lcp(u,y) \geq |u_2|$. Let $e=\p{U}=\q{U}$. 
Then $x = U^2u_2z$ for some $z$ and thus,  $x={u_1}^eu_2{u_1}^e{\underline{{u_1}^eu_2{u_1}^eu_2}}z$, i.e. there is a
farther occurrence of $u^2$ (underlined), a contradiction.

Lemma <ref> yields a straightforward induction step whenever 1/2|G|1/3|T|≥ d. 
By Lemma <ref>, this condition always holds except for the two cases: either V is a right cyclic shift of U by 1 position and hence an  of U, since then 1/2|G|1/3|T|=
1/2+1/3=5/6 1, or 
V is a  of U and such that 
v_[1]<u_[1] – hence Lemma <ref> is not
applicable. Therefore the whole
group of s and s of U must be dealt together in the
induction
rather than carrying it from one  to another. Since a  of U
does not provide a sufficiently large tail to offset all of the s and
s of U preceding it, we have to include them in the special treatment as
well – this is all precisely defined and explained in Section <ref>.
First we need to strengthens the bound on the length of the maximal right
cyclic shift of U when U=U.

i.e. x = U^2y for some, possibly empty, y, then 
lcp(u,y)<min{|y|,|u_2|}.

 §.§ Handling α, β, and γ mates



The basic unit for our induction is what we call U family ,
or equivalently family of U , 
which is presented in Definition <ref>.



Let x be a string starting with an  U. 
If all s in x are s of U, then U family consists of U and all its s. Otherwise, let V be the rightmost 
 that is not an  of U. If V is not a  of U, then U family consists of U and its s. In all other
cases U family consists of U and all its s, s, and s.
",U family;family of U;U family;U family;U family,"
In this section, we only consider strings containing at least one . Let δ(x) denote the number of s in x.
We  prove by induction that δ(x)≤7/8|x|­3/8|u|  where u is the generator of the shorter square of the 
first  in x. 
We first need to investigate the relationship between two s of x as the induction hypothesis is 
applied to the substring starting at some  and extended to the
string starting with the first . 



Let x be a string starting with an  U and let V be another  of x with u_[1]≤v_[1]. 
Let x' be the suffix of x starting at the same position as V.
Let d be the number of s 
between U and V including U but not including V. 
Then, δ(x')≤5/6|x'|­1/3|v| implies δ(x)≤5/6|x|­1/3|u|d­1/2|G( U, V)|­1/3|T( U, V)|.



As |G||v|=|u||T|, we have ­1/3|v|=­1/3|u|­1/3|T|1/3|G|.
Thus, δ(x)≤ dδ(x')≤ d5/6|x'|­1/3|v|=
d5/6|x'|­1/3|u|­1/3|T|1/3|G|. 
Thus, δ(x)≤5/6(|x'||G|)­1/3|u| d­5/6|G|1/3|G|­1/3|T|

This $A$-module $\underline{A}\otimes H$ is called the $\mathbf{k}%

We can define a functor $\operatorname*{Mod}\nolimits_{\mathbf{k}}%

%where the constant in the $o(\cdot)$ notation depends on $p$ and $r$ and the
%$q$ that comes from the definition of \pDqbounded\ of exponent $r$.
\end {theorem}

In the motivating
examples of Section~\ref{s:intro} (excluding Corollary~\ref{cor:partial}), we
discussed the case where the entries of the matrix are i.i.d.; however, in
general the distributions of the entries are allowed to differ (and even
depend on $n$), so long as the entries all take values in the same structured
set $S$ described above.
%
The condition that $S$ has additive structure seems to be an artifact of the
proof (in particular, at certain points in the proof of Theorem~\ref{structure
theorem}, we need the set $\lt\{\sum_{j=1}^n x_j : x_j \in S \mbox{ for all }
j\rt\}$ to have cardinality at most $n^{o(n)}$).  The easiest way to guarantee
that $S$ has the required structure is to assume that the set of values taken
by all the $\alpha_{jk}$ has cardinality at most $O(1)$, and this is the
approach we take for the corollaries in Section~\ref{S:examples}, since it
also makes it easy to demonstrate that the collection of entries is \pDqbdr.

\begin{remark}[Strict positivity in Inequality~\eqref{pDqbounded}]
\label{rem:strict positivity}
Note that the constants $\mu,\psubls, \bsubls$ must be such that the right-hand side of Equation~\eqref{pDqbounded} is non-negative.  It turns out for
the proof of Theorem~\ref{main theorem} that we will need slightly more.
%
At one point in the proof, we will apply Lemma~\ref{fxi_lower}, for which we
we must assume that there exists a very small constant $\epmo>0$ such that $\bb
E(e(\betasupermu_{jk} t))> \epmo$  for all $t$ and for all $\betasupermu_{jk}$
used in the definition of \pDqbounded\ of exponent $r$.  Of course, if the
expectations are not strictly larger than $\epmo$, we can simply reduce $\mu$
by $\epsilon_{-1}>0$.  Then, since we are assuming $1-\mu=p$, we clearly have
that all the $\alpha_{jk}$ are $(p+\epsilon_{-1})$-bounded of exponent $r$
(by using $\betasuper{\mu-\epmo}_{jk}$ instead of $\betasupermu_{jk}$) and we
have that $\bb E(e(\betasuper{\mu-\epmo}_{jk} t))> \epmo>0$.  Since
Theorem~\ref{main theorem} would thus yield a bound of
$\lt((p+\epsilon_{-1})^{1/r} + o(1)\rt)^n$ for every $\epsilon_{-1}>0$, we can
conclude a bound of $\lt(p^{1/r} + o(1)\rt)^n$ by letting $\epmo$ tend to 0.
Thus, without loss of generality, we will assume that $\bb
E(e(\betasupermu_{jk} t))> \epmo$ for all $t$ and for all $\betasupermu_{jk}$
used in the definition of \pDqbounded\ of exponent $r$.  \end{remark}




\section{Some corollaries of Theorem~\ref{main theorem}} 
\label{S:examples}

In this section, we will state a number of corollaries of Theorem~\ref{main
theorem}, starting with short proofs of Inequalities~\eqref{result 1},
\eqref{result 2}, and \eqref{result 3}.  The two most interesting results in
this section will be more general: first (in Section~\ref{ss:sym}), we will
show an exponential bound on the singularity probability for a matrix with
independent entries
each a symmetric random variable taking values in $\sov\subset \bb
C$, where $\abs \sov\le O(1)$ and assuming that each entry takes the value 0 with probability $1-\mu$; and
second (in Section~\ref{S:gen asym}), we will describe a similar (and
sometimes better) bound when the condition that the random variables have
symmetric distributions is replaced
with the assumption that no entry takes a value with probability greater than
$p$.  In the first case, the bound will depend only the value of $\mu$, and in
the second case, the bound will depend only on the value of $p$.
In Section~\ref{ss:fxt}, we will show an exponential bound on the singularity
probability for an $n$ by $n$  matrix with $\fxt = o(n)$ fixed rows containing
small integer values and with the remaining rows containing independent random
variables taking values in $S\subset \bb C$, where $\abs S\le O(1)$ (this is
similar to Corollary~\ref{cor:partial}, which is proved in
Section~\ref{S:fxt}).  Finally, in Section~\ref{ss:eigen}, we will prove an
exponential upper bound on the probability that a random integer matrix has a
rational eigenvalue.

In each corollary, we will use the definition of \pDqbounded\ of exponent 1
and of exponent 2.  The definition of \pDqbounded\ of exponent 2 is
particularly useful, since then the absolute value on the left-hand side of
Inequality~\eqref{pDqbounded} is automatically dealt with; however, when $\mu$
is small (for example whenever $\mu \le 1/2$), one can get better bounds by
using \pDqbounded\ of exponent 1.  We have not yet found an example where the
best possible bound from Theorem~\ref{main theorem} is found by using
\pDqbounded\ of an exponent higher than 2.

\subsection{Proving Inequalities~\eqref{result 1}, \eqref{result 2}, and
\eqref{result 3}}

To prove Inequality~\eqref{result 1}, we note for 
$0 \le\mu \le \frac12$ that (using the definition in
Equation~\eqref{definition of gammasupermu} of $\gammasupermu $) 
\begin{equation*}
\abs{\mathbb E(e(\gammasupermu t))} = 1 - \mu + \mu \cos(2\pi t),
\end{equation*}
%
and thus $\gammasupermu$ is $(1-\mu)$-bounded of exponent 1
(i.e., take $\betasupermu:=\gammasupermu$), and so Inequality~\eqref{result 1}
follows from Theorem~\ref{main theorem}.


To prove Inequality~\eqref{result 2}, we note for $\frac12 \le \mu
\le 1$ that 
\begin{equation*}
\abs{\mathbb E(e(\gammasupermu t))} = \abs{1 - \mu + \mu \cos( 2\pi t)} \le
\pfrac{2\mu+1}{4} +(1-\mu)\cos(2\pi t) + \pfrac{2\mu-1}{4}\cos(4\pi t)
\end{equation*}
%
(the inequality above may be checked by squaring both sides and expanding as
polynomials in $\cos(2\pi t)$).  Thus, we can take 
\e{
	\betasupermu:= \begin{cases}
	+2 &\mbox{ with probability } \frac{2\mu-1}{8} \\
	-2 &\mbox{ with probability } \frac{2\mu-1}{8} \\
	+1 &\mbox{ with probability } \frac{1-\mu}{2} \\
	-1 &\mbox{ with probability } \frac{1-\mu}{2} \\
	0 &\mbox{ with probability } \frac{2\mu+1}{4}
	\end{cases}
}
to see that $\gammasupermu$ is $\displaystyle \left(\frac{2\mu+1}{4}
\right)$-bounded of exponent 1, and so Inequality~\eqref{result 2} follows
from Theorem~\ref{main theorem}.

To prove Inequality~\eqref{result 3}, we note for $0 \le\mu
\le 1$ that 
\begin{equation*}
\abs{\mathbb E(e(\gammasupermu t))}^2 = \abs{1 - \mu + \mu \cos( 2\pi t)}^2 
= 1-2\mu+\frac32 \mu^2 +2(1-\mu)\mu\cos(2\pi t) + \pfrac{\mu^2}{2}\cos(4\pi
t).
\end{equation*}
%
Thus, we can take 
\e{
	\betasupermu:= \begin{cases}
	+2 &\mbox{ with probability } \frac{\mu^2}{4} \\
	-2 &\mbox{ with probability } \frac{\mu^2}{4} \\
	+1 &\mbox{ with probability } (1-\mu)\mu \\
	-1 &\mbox{ with probability } (1-\mu)\mu \\
	0 &\mbox{ with probability }  1-2\mu+\frac32 \mu^2
	\end{cases}
}
to see that $\gammasupermu$ is $\displaystyle \left(1-2\mu+\frac32 \mu^2
\right)$-bounded of exponent 2, and so Inequality~\eqref{result 3} follows
from Theorem~\ref{main theorem}.


\subsection{Matrices with entries having symmetric distributions}\label{ss:sym}

In this subsection, we will prove a singularity bound for an $n$ by $n$ matrix
$\glmu$ for which each entry is a symmetric discrete random variable
taking the value 0 with probability $1-\mu$.

\begin{corollary}\label{gen result}
Let $\sov$ be a set of complex numbers with cardinality $\abs \sov \le O(1)$.
If $\glmu$ is an $n$ by $n$ matrix in which each entry is an independent
symmetric complex random variable taking values in $S$ and taking the
value 0 with probability $1-\mu$, then
\e{
	\Pr(\glmu \mbox{ is singular}) \le
	\begin{cases}
		(1-\mu + o(1))^n &\mbox{ for } 0\le\mu\le\frac12 \\[5pt]
		\left(\frac{2\mu+1}{4} + o(1)\rt)^n&\mbox{ for } \frac12\le\mu\le1
		\\[5pt]
		\lt(\sqrt{1-2\mu +\frac32\mu^2} +o(1)\rt)^n &\mbox{ for }0\le\mu\le 1.
	\end{cases}
}
In particular, the same upper bounds as in Inequalities~\eqref{result 1},
\eqref{result 2}, and \eqref{result 3} (which are shown in Figure~\ref{figure
1}) apply to the singularity probability for $\glmu$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Let $\alpha_{ij}$ be an entry of $\glmu$.  Since $\alpha_{ij}$ is symmetric
and takes the value 0 with probability $1-\mu$, we may write $\alpha_{ij} =
\gammasupermu_{ij} \eta_{ij}$, where $\gammasupermu_{ij}$ is an independent
copy of $\gammasupermu$ as defined in Equation~\eqref{definition of
gammasupermu} and $\eta_{ij}$ is a random variable that shares no values
with $-\eta_{ij}$.  This description of $\alpha_{ij}$ was inspired by
\cite{BerDecomp}, and it allows us to condition on $\eta_{ij}$ and then use the
remaining randomness in $\gammasupermu_{ij}$ to get a bound on the singularity
probability.  In particular,
\e{%\label{totprob}
	\Pr(\glmu \mbox{ is singular}) &= \sum_{(c_{ij})} 
	\Pr(\glmu \mbox{ is singular} | \{\eta_{ij} =c_{ij}\}) \Pr(\{\eta_{ij}
	=c_{ij}\}),
}
where the sum runs over all $(n^2)$-tuples $(c_{ij})_{1\le i,j\le n}$ of
possible values taken by random variables $\eta_{ij}$.  Since
$\sum_{(c_{ij})}  \Pr(\{\eta_{ij} =c_{ij}\}) =1$, we can
complete the proof by proving an exponential bound on $\Pr(\glmu \mbox{ is
singular} | \{\eta_{ij} =c_{ij}\})$, and we will use Theorem~\ref{main
theorem} for this task.  

Consider the random matrix $\fglmu$, where the $i,j$ entry is the random
variable $c_{ij}\gammasupermu_{ij}$ for some constant $c_{ij}$.  Note that the
entries of $\fglmu$ take values in $S$, a set with cardinality $O(1)$, and let
$\qmap$ be the map from Lemma~\ref{reduction theorem}, which lets us pass to
the case where $\fglmu$ has entries in $\Zmodp$.  Defining $\theta_{ij}:=
2\pi\qmap(c_{ij})$, we compute
\e{
	&\hspace{-1cm} \abs{\bb E e(\qmap(c_{ij}\gammasupermu_{ij}) t)} 
	=\abs{ 1-\mu+ \mu \cos(\theta_{ij}t) }
	\\
	\qquad&\le \begin{cases}
1-\mu+ \mu \cos(\theta_{ij}t)
	&\mbox{ for } 0\le\mu\le\frac12, \\[5pt]
%
\frac{2\mu+1}{4} +(1-\mu)\cos(\theta_{ij}t) +
\pfrac{2\mu-1}{4}\cos(2\theta_{ij} t)
	&\mbox{ for } \frac12\le\mu\le 1, \mbox{ and } \\[5pt]
%
\dsp
\lt(\rule{0pt}{11pt} 
1-2\mu+\frac32 \mu^2 +2(1-\mu)\mu \cos(\theta_{ij} t) +
\frac{\mu^2}{2}\cos(2\theta_{ij} t) \rt)^{1/2}
	&\mbox{ for } 0\le\mu\le 1.
\end{cases}
}
We have thus shown that the entries of $\fglmu$ are
\e{
	&\lt(1-\mu\rt)\mbox{-bounded of exponent 1 for }
	0\le\mu\le\frac12,\\
	%
	&\lt(\frac{2\mu+1}{4}\rt)\mbox{-bounded of exponent 1 for } 
		\frac12 \le \mu\le 1, \mbox{ and}\\	
	&\lt(1-2\mu+\frac32\mu^2\rt)\mbox{-bounded of exponent 2 for } 
		0\le \mu\le 1.	
}
Applying Theorem~\ref{main theorem} completes the proof.  \end{proof}

Corollary~\ref{gen result} is tight for $0\le\mu\le \frac12$, since the
probability of a row of all zeroes occurring is $(1-\mu +o(1))^n$; however,
for any specific case, Theorem~\ref{main theorem} can usually prove better
upper bounds than those given by Corollary~\ref{gen result}. 


For example, consider the case of a matrix $\gensmu$ with each entry an
independent copy of the symmetric random variable
\e{
	\alsmu:= 
\begin{cases}
	+2 &\mbox{ with probability } \frac{\mu}{4} \\
	-2 &\mbox{ with probability } \frac{\mu}{4} \\
	+1 &\mbox{ with probability } \frac{\mu}{4} \\
	-1 &\mbox{ with probability } \frac{\mu}{4} \\
	0  &\mbox{ with probability } 1-\mu
	\end{cases}
}

\begin{corollary} \label{pm2case}
For $\gensmu$ as defined above, we have
\e{
	\Pr(\gensmu \mbox{ is singular}) \le 
	\begin{cases}
	(1-\mu + o(1) )^n &\mbox{ for } 0 \le \mu \le \frac{16}{25}\\[5pt]
	\lt(\sqrt{1-2\mu+\frac54 \mu^2} + o(1) \rt)^n &\mbox{ for } 0\le\mu\le 1.
	\end{cases}
}
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
By the definition of $\alsmu$ we have
\e{
	\abs{\bb E e(\alsmu t)} = 1-\mu +\frac{\mu}2 \cos(2\pi t) +\frac{\mu}2
	\cos(4\pi t),\qquad\mbox{ for } 0\le\mu\le\frac{16}{25}
}
(i.e., the right-hand side of the equation above is non-negative for such
$\mu$), which proves the first bound.  

Also, we have
\e{
	\abs{\bb E e(\alsmu t)}^2 &= 1-2\mu+\frac54\mu^2 +
	\lt(\mu-\frac{3}4\mu^2\rt) \cos(2\pi t) + \lt(\mu-\frac{7}8\mu^2\rt)
	\cos(4\pi t) \\
&\rule{3in}{0pt}+ \frac{\mu^2}4 \cos(6\pi t) + \frac{\mu^2}8 \cos(8\pi t)
}
for $ 0\le\mu\le1$, which proves the second bound.  
%This upper bound is also a special case of Corollary~\ref{gen asym}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Random  matrices with entries having arbitrary distributions}
\label{S:gen asym}

A useful feature of the definition of \pDqbounded\ of exponent 2 is that it
lets one bound the singularity probability of matrices with independent discrete
random variables that are asymmetric. 

\begin{corollary}\label{gen asym}
Let $p$ be a constant such that $0<p\le 1$ and let $\sov\subset \bb C$ be a set
with cardinality $\abs \sov \le O(1)$.
If $\glm$ is an $n$ by $n$ matrix with independent random entries taking
values in $S$ such that for any entry $\alpha$, we have $\max_x \Pr(\alpha =
x)\le p$, then
$$\Pr(\glm \mbox{ is singular})\le (\sqrt p + o(1))^n.$$
\end{corollary}

We will need the following slightly more general corollary in
Section~\ref{ss:fxt}. For a set $A$ and an integer $m$, we will use the
notation $mA :=\{ \sum_{j=1}^m a_j : a_j \in A\}$ and $A^m:= \{ \prod_{j=1}^m
a_j : a_j \in A\}$. 

\begin{corollary}\label{gen asym2}
Let $p$ be a constant such that $0<p\le 1$, let $\sov\subset \bb C$ be a set
with cardinality $\abs \sov \le O(1)$, and let $X_n$ be an $n$ by $n$ matrix
with fixed, non-random entries in $n^{o(n)}(S \cup \{-1,0,1\})^{O(1)}$.
If $\glm$ is an $n$ by $n$ matrix with independent random entries taking
values in $S$ such that for any entry $\alpha$, we have $\max_x \Pr(\alpha =
x)\le p$, then
$$\Pr(X_n + \glm \mbox{ is singular})\le (\sqrt p + o(1))^n.$$
\end{corollary}
\noindent
Note that that Corollary~\ref{gen asym2} implies Corollary~\ref{gen asym} by
taking $X_n$ to be the matrix of all zeroes. 

\begin{proof}[Proof of Corollary~\ref{gen asym2}]
Let $\alpha_{ij}$ be an entry in $\glm$.  Our goal is to describe
$\alpha_{ij}$ in a two-step random process, condition on one of the steps, and
then use the randomness in the other step to bound the singularity
probability.  The conditioning approach is the same as that used in the
symmetric case (Corollary~\ref{gen result}) and was inspired by
\cite{BerDecomp}.  The conditioning argument is useful since some entries of
the random matrix may take some values with very small probability (i.e.
probability less than any constant);  recall that while the entries of the
random matrix always take values in a fixed set $S$ of cardinality $O(1)$, the
distributions of those random variables within $S$ are allowed to
vary with $n$.  (Note that making use of Remark~\ref{rlax} would provide an
alternate way of dealing with entries that take some values with very small
probability.)


Say that $\alpha_{ij}$ takes the values $v_1,\ldots,v_t$
with probabilities $\varrho_1,\ldots, \varrho_t$, respectively, where
$\varrho_1\ge \varrho_2 \ge \cdots\ge \varrho_t$.  Define new random variables
$\eta_{ijk}$ such that for some $i_0$
and $i_1$, the values taken by $\eta_{ijk}$ are $v_{i_0},
v_{i_0+1},\ldots,v_{i_0 + i_1}$ with corresponding probabilities
$\varrho_{i_0}/p_k,
\varrho_{i_0+1}/p_k,\ldots,\varrho_{i_0 + i_1}/p_k$, where $p_k:=
\sum_{i=1}^{i_1}\varrho_{i_0 + i}$.  Thus, we can write
\en{ \label{couple}
	\alpha_{ij} = \begin{cases}
	\eta_{ij1} & \mbox{ with probability } p_1 \\
	\eta_{ij2} & \mbox{ with probability } p_2 \\
	\vdots & \vdots \\
	\eta_{ij\ell} & \mbox{ with probability } p_\ell.
	\end{cases}
}
Furthermore, the $\eta_{ijk}$ can be constructed so that $p_k \le p$ for
every $k$, so that $p/2 \le p_k$ for $1\le k \le \ell -1$, and so that no two
$\eta_{ijk}$ with different $k$'s ever take the same value.  
%Thus, $\ell \le \ceiling{2/p} + 1$.

There are two cases to consider for the technical reason that $p_\ell$ is not
necessarily bounded below by a constant.  Let $\epsilon>0$ be
a very small constant, so for example $p/2> \epsilon$.  Case 1 is when $\epsilon\le p_\ell$, and in this case each
$p_k$ is bounded below by $\epsilon$ and above  by $p$.
We will consider Case 1 first and then discuss the
small changes needed to deal with Case 2.

As in the proof of Corollary~\ref{gen result}, we will
condition on the values taken by the $\eta_{ijk}$ in order to prove a
bound on the singularity probability.  We have that 
$$\Pr(X_n + \glm \mbox{ is singular}) = \sum_{(c_{ijk})} \Pr(X_n + \glm\mbox{ is
singular} | \{\eta_{ijk}=c_{ijk}\}) \Pr(\{\eta_{ijk}=c_{ijk}\}),$$
where the sum runs over all possible values $(c_{ijk})$ that the $\eta_{ijk}$
can take.  Thus, it is sufficient to prove a bound on the singularity
probability for the random matrix $X_n + \fglm$ which has random entries
\e{
	\xij+\widetilde\alpha_{ij} = \begin{cases}
	\xij+c_{ij1} & \mbox{ with probability } p_1 \\
	\xij+c_{ij2} & \mbox{ with probability } p_2 \\
	\vdots & \vdots \\
	\xij+c_{ij\ell} & \mbox{ with probability } p_\ell,
	\end{cases}
}
where $\xij$ and the $c_{ijk}$ are constants.

Note the entries of $X_n+\fglm$ take values in $\nonS$, a \gap\ with rank
$O(1)$ and cardinality at most $n^{o(n)}$, and let $\qmap$ be the
map from Lemma~\ref{reduction theorem}, which lets us pass to the case where
$X_n+\fglm$ has entries in $\Zmodp$.  Defining $\theta_{ijk}:=
2\pi\qmap(c_{ijk})$ and letting $\widetilde\alpha'_{ij}$ be an i.i.d. copy of $\widetilde\alpha_{ij}$, we compute
\e{
	\abs{\bb E e(\qmap(\xij+\widetilde\alpha_{ij}) t)}^2 
	&=\bb E e
	\lt(\rule{0pt}{11pt}
	\qmap(\xij+\widetilde\alpha_{ij}-\xij-\widetilde\alpha_{ij}') t\rt) 
	=\bb E e
	\lt(\rule{0pt}{11pt}
	\qmap(\widetilde\alpha_{ij}-\widetilde\alpha_{ij}') t\rt) 
%
	\\
	&= \sum_{k=1}^\ell p_k^2 + 2 \sum_{1\le k_1<k_2\le \ell} p_{k_1} p_{k_2}
	\cos((\theta_{ijk_1}-\theta_{ijk_2})t).
}
Thus, $\xij+\widetilde\alpha_{ij}$ is $\lt(\sum_{k=1}^\ell p_k^2\rt)$-bounded of
exponent 2 (using the constant $q = \epsilon^2$ in Definition~\ref{definition
pDqbounded}, so $q$ does not depend on $n$). Given that $0<p_k\le p$ for every
$k$, it is not hard to show that $\sum_{k=1}^\ell p_k^2  \le p< p+\epsilon$,
and so from Definition~\ref{definition pDqbounded}, we see that the collection
$\{\xij+\widetilde\alpha_{ij}: \widetilde\alpha_{ij}\mbox{ has corresponding
probability } p_\ell \ge \epsilon\}$ is $\lt(p + \epsilon\rt)$-bounded of
exponent 2.  We are thus finished with Case 1.

Case 2 is when the decomposition of $\alpha_{ij}$ given in Equation~\eqref{couple} has
$p_\ell < \epsilon$.  In this case we need to modify Equation~\eqref{couple}
slightly, deleting $\eta_{ij\ell}$ and replacing $\eta_{ij(\ell-1)}$ with a new
variable $\eta_{ij(\ell-1)}'$ that takes all the values previously taken by
$\eta_{ij\ell}$ and by $\eta_{ij(\ell-1)}$ with the appropriate probabilities.  
Thus, in Case 2, we have that $p/2\le p_k < p+\epsilon$ for all $1\le k\le
\ell -1$, showing that each $p_k$ is bounded below by a constant and is
bounded above by $p+\epsilon$ (here we are using $p_{\ell -1}$ to denote
the probability that $\alpha_{ij}$ draws a value from the random variable
$\eta_{ij(\ell-1)}'$).

For Case 2, we use exactly the same reasoning as in Case 1 above to show that 
such entries of $X_n+\fglm$ are $\lt(\sum_{k=1}^{\ell-1} p_k^2\rt)$-bounded of
exponent 2 (using the constant $q=\epsilon^2<p^2/4$ in
Definition~\ref{definition pDqbounded}, so $q$ does not depend on $n$). Noting
that $\sum_{k=1}^{\ell-1} p_k^2<p+\epsilon$ and using
Definition~\ref{definition pDqbounded}, we see that the collection
$\{\xij+\widetilde\alpha_{ij}: \widetilde\alpha_{ij}\mbox{ has corresponding
probability } p_\ell < \epsilon\}$ is $\lt(p + \epsilon\rt)$-bounded of
exponent 2.

Combining Case 1 and Case 2, we have that the collection
$\{\xij+\widetilde\alpha_{ij}\}$ is $\lt(p + \epsilon\rt)$-bounded of exponent
2, and so by and by Theorem~\ref{main theorem} we have that $\Pr(X_n+\fglm
\mbox{ is singular}) 
%= \Pr(X_n+\glm \mbox{ is singular} | \{\eta_{ijk}=c_{ijk}\}) 
\le \lt(\sqrt{p +\epsilon} + o(1)\rt)^n$.

The constant $\epsilon>0$ was chosen arbitrarily, and so letting
$\epsilon$ tend to zero, we get that 
$$ \Pr(X_n+\glm \mbox{ is singular} |
\{\eta_{ijk}=c_{ijk}\}) \le \lt( \sqrt p + o(1)\rt)^n.$$
%
\end{proof}


\subsection{Partially random matrices }
\label{ss:fxt}

In this subsection, we prove a bound on the singularity probability for partly
random matrices where many rows are deterministic.

\begin{corollary} \label{cor:partial1} 
Let $p$ be a real constant between 0 and 1, let $K$ be a large positive
constant, and let $S\subset \bb C$ be a set of complex numbers having
cardinality $\abs S \le K$.  Let $\fmat$ be an $n$ by $n$ matrix in which
$\fxt$ rows contain fixed, non-random integers between $-K$ and $K$ and where
the other rows contain entries that are independent random variables taking
values in $S$.  If $\fxt \le o(n)$, if the $\fxt$ fixed rows are linearly
independent, and if for every random entry $\alpha$, we have $\max_x \Pr(\alpha
= x) \le p$, then
$$\Pr(\fmat \mbox{ is singular})\le \lt(\sqrt p + o(1)\rt)^{n-\fxt}.$$
\end{corollary}

Corollary~\ref{cor:partial1} applies
to partly random matrices with $\fxt = o(n)$ fixed, non-random rows containing
integers bounded by a constant and with random entries taking at most $O(1)$
values in the complex numbers.   Corollary~\ref{cor:partial}, on the other
hand, holds with the fixed entries also allowed to take values in the complex
numbers and gives a sligtly better bound, but additionally requires $\fxt \le
O(\ln n)$ (which is far smaller in general than $o(n)$).  Proving
Corollary~\ref{cor:partial} requires mirroring the entire argument used to
prove the main theorem (Theorem~\ref{main theorem}) in the case where $\fxt$
rows contain fixed, non-random entires, and we discuss this argument in
Section~\ref{S:fxt}.  Proving Corollary~\ref{cor:partial1}, however, can be
done directly from Theorem~\ref{main theorem}, as we will show below.  First,
we will state a generalization of Corollary~\ref{cor:partial1}.

\begin{corollary} \label{cor:partial2} 
Let $p$ be a real constant between 0 and 1, let $K$ be a large positive
constant, and let $S\subset \bb C$ be a set of complex numbers having
cardinality $\abs S \le K$.   Let $\fmat$ be an $n$ by $n$ matrix in which
$\fxt$ rows contain fixed, non-random integers between $-K$ and $K$ and where
the other rows contain entries that are independent random variables taking
values in $S$. If $\fxt \le o(n)$, if the fixed rows have co-rank $k$, 
and if for every random entry $\alpha$, we have $\max_x \Pr(\alpha =
x) \le p$, then
$$\Pr(\fmat \mbox{ has co-rank } >k)\le \lt(\sqrt p + o(1)\rt)^{n-\fxt}.$$
\end{corollary}


To obtain Corollary \ref{cor:partial2} from Corollary \ref{cor:partial1}, find
a collection $\mc C$ of $\fxt-k$ linearly independent rows among the
deterministic rows. Replace the rest of the deterministic rows with a
collection $\mc C'$ of rows containing integer values between $-K$ and $K$
such that $\mc C'$ is linearly independent from $\mc C$. Finally, apply
Corollary \ref{cor:partial1} to the new partially random matrix whose
deterministic rows are from $\mc C \cup \mc C'$, thus proving
Corollary~\ref{cor:partial2}. 


\begin{proof}[Proof of Corollary~\ref{cor:partial1}]
By reordering the rows and columns, we may write
$$\fmat = \lt(\begin{array}{c|c} 
A & B \\
\hline
C& D
\end{array}\rt),$$
where $A$ is an $\fxt$ by $\fxt$ non-random invertible matrix, $B$ is an
$\fxt$ by $n-\fxt$ non-random matrix, $C$ is an $n-\fxt$ by $\fxt$ random
matrix, and $D$ is an $n-\fxt$ by $n-\fxt$ random matrix.  Note that $\fmat$
is singular if and only if there exists a vector $\mathbf v$ such that $\fmat
\mathbf v =0$.  Let $\mathbf v_1$ be the first $\fxt$ coordinates of $\mathbf
v$ and let $\mathbf v_2$ be the remaining $n-\fxt$ coordinates.  Then $\fmat
\mathbf v = 0$ if and only if
$$\begin{cases}
A \mathbf v_1 + B \mathbf v_2 = 0, \mbox{ and } \\
C \mathbf v_1 + D \mathbf v_2 = 0.
\end{cases}
$$
Since $A$ is invertible, these two equations are satisfied if and only if
$(-CA^{-1}B + D) \mathbf v_2 = 0$, that is, if and only if the random matrix
$-CA^{-1}B + D$ is singular.  

We want to show that every entry that can appear in $-CA^{-1}B$ is an element
of $\nonS$.  By the cofactor formula for $A^{-1}$, we know that the $i,j$
entry of $A^{-1}$ is $(-1)^{i+j}(\det A_{ij})/\det A$, where $A_{ij}$ is the
$\fxt-1$ by $\fxt-1$ matrix formed by deleting the $i$-th row and $j$-th
column of $A$.  Thus, $A^{-1} = \frac1{\det A} \widetilde A$, where the $i,j$
entry of $\widetilde A$ is $(-1)^{i+j}\det A_{ij}$.  By the volume formula for
the determinant, we know that $\abs{\det A}$ is at most the product of the
lengths of the row vectors of $A$; and thus $\abs{\det A} \le n^{o(n)}$ (here
we need that $A$ has integer entries between $-K$ and $K$, where $K$ is a
constant, and that $\fxt \le o(n)$).  Similarly, we have $\abs{\det A_{ij}}\le
n^{o(n)}$.  Every entry of $\widetilde A$ is thus in $n^{o(n)}\{-1,0,1\}$, every
entry of $C$ is in $S$, and every entry of $B$ is in $O(1)\{-1,0,1\}$; thus,
every entry of $-C\widetilde A B$ is an element of $n^{o(n)}(S\cup \{-1,0,1\})$. 


Conditioning on the values taken by all the entries in $C$, we have
\en{
	\Pr(\fmat\mbox{ is singular}) &= \Pr(-CA^{-1}B + D\mbox{ is singular})
	\nonumber \\
	& = \sum_{(c_{ij})} \Pr(-CA^{-1}B + D \mbox{ is singular}| C= (c_{ij}))
	\Pr(C = (c_{ij})), \label{cond-form}
}
where the sum runs over all possible matrices $(c_{ij})$ that
$C$ can produce.   Considering the entries in $C=(c_{ij})$ to be fixed (note
that $A$ and $B$ are fixed by assumption), we now need to bound 
$$\Pr(-(c_{ij})A^{-1}B + D \mbox{ is singular})
=\Pr(-(c_{ij})\widetilde AB + (\det A) D \mbox{ is singular}).$$
Note that every entry of $-(c_{ij})\widetilde AB$ is an element of $\nonS$
and that the random matrix $(\det A) D$ has entries that take values in the
fixed set $\{(\det A) s: s\in S\}$ having cardinality $O(1)$.  Thus, by
Corollary~\ref{gen asym2}, we have that 
$$\Pr(-(c_{ij})\widetilde AB + (\det A) D \mbox{ is singular}) \le (\sqrt p +
o(1))^{n-\fxt}.$$
Plugging this bound back into Equation~\eqref{cond-form} completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Integer matrices and rational eigenvalues}\label{ss:eigen}

Let $\eta_k$ be the random variable taking the values $-k, -k+1, \ldots, k-1,
k$ each with equal probability, and let $M_n$ be the $n$ by $n$ matrix where
each entry is an independent copy of $\eta_k$.  In \cite{WongMart}, Martin and
Wong show that for any $\epsilon >0$, $$\Pr(M_n \mbox{ has a rational
eigenvalue}) \le \frac{c(n,\epsilon)}{ k^{1-\epsilon}},$$ 
%the matrix $M_n$ has a rational eigenvalue with probability $\le
%c(n,\epsilon) /k^{1-\epsilon}$, 
where $c(n,\epsilon)$ is a constant depending on $n$ and $\epsilon$.  (One
goal in \cite{WongMart} is to study this bound as $k$ goes to $\infty$ while
$n$ is fixed, which is why $c(n,\epsilon)$ is allowed to depend on $n$.)  


Below, we prove a similar result for random integer matrices with
entries between $-k$ and $k$ (with $k$ fixed), where we allow each entry to
have a different (independent) distribution and we also allow the
distributions to be very general.
%
\begin{corollary}\label{norat}
Fix a positive integer $k$, and let $\Mkn$ be a random integer matrix with
independent entries, each of which takes values in the set
$\{-k,-k+1,\ldots,k-1, k\}$.  
Let $c$ be a constant such that for every entry $\alpha$,  we have
$\max_{-k\le x\le k}\Pr(\alpha =x) \le c/k$.
Then 
$$\Pr(\Mkn \mbox{ has a rational eigenvalue}) \le
\lt(\frac{c}{k} + o(1)\rt)^{n/2},$$
where the $o(1)$ term goes to zero as $n$ goes to $\infty$.
\end{corollary}

%The corollary above is only meaningful in the case where $0<c<k$, since, for example, 
\noindent
For example, in the case where each independent entry has the uniform
distribution on $\{-k,-k+1,\ldots,k-1, k\}$ (as in \cite{WongMart}), one can
set $c=1/2$ in the corollary above.

\begin{proof}
The proof given below follows the same outline as the main theorem of
\cite{WongMart}, with Corollary~\ref{cor:partial} replacing an appeal to
\cite[Lemma~1]{WongMart}.  

The characteristic polynomial for $\Mkn$ is monic with integer coefficients,
and thus the only possible rational eigenvalues are integers (by the rational
roots theorem).  Every eigenvalue of $\Mkn$ has absolute value at most $nk$
(see \cite[Lemma~4]{WongMart}); thus, the only possible integer eigenvalues are
between $-nk$ and $nk$.  

The matrix $\Mkn$ has $\lambda$ as an eigenvalue if and only if $\Mkn -
\lambda I$ is singular (where $I$ is the $n$ by $n$ identity matrix).  By
Corollary~\ref{cor:partial} (with $\fxt = 0$), we have
$$ \Pr(\Mkn - \lambda I \mbox{ is singular}) \le \lt( \sqrt{\frac{c}{k}} +
o(1)\rt)^n.$$
Using the union bound, we have
\e{
	\Pr(\Mkn \mbox{ has a rational eigenvalue}) &=
	%\\
	\Pr(\Mkn -\lambda I  \mbox{ is singular, for some $\lambda \in
	\{-nk,\ldots,nk\}$})\\
	&\le \sum_{\lambda = -nk}^{nk}  \Pr(\Mkn - \lambda I \mbox{ is singular}) \\
	&\le (2nk +1) \lt( \sqrt{\frac{c}{k}} + o(1)\rt)^n\\
	&\le \lt( \frac{c}{k} + o(1)\rt)^{n/2}.
}
\end{proof}



\section{Random matrices with complex entries:
A reduction technique}
\label{reducing from thereals}


The original work on discrete random matrices in \cite{Kom, KKS, TV1, TV2} is
concerned with matrices having integer entries, which can also be viewed as
matrices with entries in $\Zmodp$ where $Q$ is a very large prime.  In this
section we show that  one can  pass from a  (random) matrix with entries in
$\bb C$ to one with entries in $\Zmodp$ where $Q$ is an arbitrarily large
prime number, all without affecting the probability that the determinant is
zero, thanks to the following lemma. 


\begin{lemma}[\cite{VWnote}]\label{reduction theorem}
Let $\sov$ be a finite subset of $\bb C$.  There exist infinitely many 
primes $Q$ such that there is a ring homomorphism $\qmap:\Z[\sov] \to \Zmodp$ 
satisfying the following two properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)]  the map $\qmap$ is injective on $\sov$, and
\item[(ii)]  for any $n$ by $n$ matrix $(s_{ij})_{1\le i,j\le n}$ with entries $s_{ij}\in S$,
we have $$\det\lt(\rule{0pt}{14pt}(s_{ij})_{1\le i,j\le n}\rt) = 0 \quad\mbox{ if and only if } \quad
\det\left(\rule{0pt}{14pt}(\qmap(s_{ij}))_{1\le i,j\le n}\right)=0.$$
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}


In order to apply this lemma, let us point out that the proof of
Theorem~\ref{main theorem}, which is discussed in Sections~\ref{S:pf} through
\ref{S:8}, works exclusively in $\Zmodp$; though at various points, it is
necessary to assume $Q$ is extremely large with respect to $n$ and various
constants.  For this paper, $S$ will be the set of  all  possible values taken
by the random variables $\alpha_{jk}$.  Recall that by assumption,
$\abs{\sov}\le n^{o(n)}$, so in particular, $S$ is finite.




\begin{remark}[On the size of $Q$]\label{sizeofQ}
When we apply Lemma~\ref{reduction theorem}, we will take $Q>\exp(\exp(Cn))$
for some constant $C$ in order for Freiman-type theorems such as
\cite[Theorem~6.3]{TV2} (which is restated in Theorem~\ref{Freiman} below) to
apply, and we will also choose $Q$ large enough so that the integral
approximation in Inequality~\eqref{approximation condition}
holds and so that $Q$ is large with respect to various constants.  One should
note that while $Q$ can be taken arbitrarily large with respect to $n$, we
cannot choose $Q$ so that it is arbitrarily large with respect to $\qmap(s)$
for all $s\in \sov$, where $\sov$ is the set of all
values that could appear in the given random matrix.  For example, if $\sqrt 2
\in \sov$, then the smallest positive integer representative for $\qmap(\sqrt
2)$ must be larger than $\sqrt Q$ (since $(\qmap(\sqrt 2))^2 = 2$ in
$\Zmodp$).  Finally, if we were in a situation where $\sov\subset \bb Q$, then
we could avoid using Lemma~\ref{reduction theorem} altogether by clearing
denominators to pass to $\bb Z$ and then take $Q\approx\exp(\exp(Cn))$, as is
done in \cite{TV2}.  \end{remark}

Lemma~\ref{reduction theorem} is a corollary of the main theorem of
\cite{VWnote} and its proof is  given in detail in \cite[Section~6]{VWnote}.
The paper  \cite{VWnote} also contains  further applications of the method
used to prove Lemma~\ref{reduction theorem}, for example proving a sum-product
result for the complex numbers and proving a Szemer\'edi-Trotter-type result
for the complex numbers, where the applications follow from the analogous
results for $\bb Z/Q$ where $Q$ is a prime (see \cite{BKT}).  The results
in \cite{VWnote}, including Lemma~\ref{reduction theorem}, all go through with
the complex numbers being replaced by any characteristic zero integral domain.
Thus, the results stated in Sections~\ref{s:intro}, \ref{s:genthm}, and
\ref{S:examples} above for the complex numbers $\bb C$ also all go through
with $\bb C$ replaced by any characteristic zero integral domain.  For
example, Corollary~\ref{gen asym} becomes
%
\begin{corollary} Let $p$ be a constant such that $0<p\le 1$ and let $D$ be a
characteristic zero integral domain.  Let $S\subset D$ have cardinality $\abs
S\le O(1)$.  If $\glm$ is an $n$ by $n$ matrix with
independent random entries, each taking values in $S$, such that for
every entry $\alpha$, we have $\max_x \Pr(\alpha = x)\le p$, then $$\Pr(\glm
\mbox{ is singular})\le (\sqrt p + o(1))^n.$$ \end{corollary}


\section{Proof of the main theorem (Theorem~\ref{main theorem})}\label{S:pf}

The proof of Theorem~\ref{main theorem} very closely follows the proof of
\cite[Theorem 1.2]{TV2}.  Our goal is to highlight
the changes that need to be made to generalize the proof in \cite{TV2}
so that it proves Theorem~\ref{main theorem}.  A reader interested in the
details of the proof of Theorem~\ref{main theorem} should read this paper
alongside of \cite{TV2}.  Throughout the proof, we will assume that $n$ is
sufficiently large, and we will allow constants hidden in the $o(\cdot)$ and
$O(\cdot)$ notation to depend on the constants $\epsilon_{-1}, \epsilon_0,
\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, p,q,r, \mediumdimconstant, \largedimconstant,
\LOEconstant,$ and $\mconst$.  The constants $\epsilon_{-1}, \epsilon_0,
\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2$ should be considered very small, and, in fact, we will
let them tend to zero to prove the full strength of  Theorem~\ref{main
theorem}.  The constants $p,q,r, \mediumdimconstant, \largedimconstant,
\LOEconstant,$ and $\mconst$ can be thought of as absolute, except possibly
for depending on each other.

\subsection{Definitions and preliminaries}\label{ss:defpre}

Given an $n$ by $n$ matrix $\generalmatrix$ with entries $\alpha_{ij}$, we
assume that the collection of independent random variables
$\{\alpha_{ij}\}_{1\le i,j\le n}$ is \pDqbdr\ for some fixed constants
$p$, $q$, and $r$ (here, $q$ is the constant from Definition~\ref{definition pDqbounded} which is independent of $n$).  We also assume that each $\alpha_{ij}$ takes at most
$n^{o(n)}$ distinct values.  Using Lemma~\ref{reduction theorem}, we may
assume without loss of generality that each $\alpha_{ij}$ takes values in
$\Zmodp$ for some very large prime $Q$.  The entirety of the proof will take
place over the field $\Zmodp$, and so terminology such as ``linearly
independent'', ``span'', ``dimension'', ``rank'' and so forth will always be
with respect to the field $\Zmodp$.

Let $X_i:=(\alpha_{i,1},\ldots,\alpha_{i,n})$ denote the $i$-th row of
$\generalmatrix$.  We note that $\generalmatrix$ has determinant zero if and
only if there is a linear dependency among the rows $X_i$.  It has been shown
(see 
%\cite[Section~2]{TV2}, 
\cite[Lemma~5.1]{TV1} and also \cite{KKS}) that the dominant contribution to
the singularity probability comes from the $X_i$ spanning a hyperplane (of
dimension $n-1$).  In particular,
\en{\label{nontriv}
	\Pr\lt(\generalmatrix \mbox{ is singular}\rt) = p^{-o(n)} 
	\mathop{\sum_{V\ \mathrm{a\ non-trivial}}}_{\mathrm{hyperplane\ in}\
	(\Zmodp)^n} \Pr(A_V),
}
where $A_V$ denotes the event that $X_1,\ldots, X_n$ span $V$, and
\emph{non-trivial} means that $V$ contains the origin, $V$ is spanned by vectors in
$S^n$ (where $S$ is the set of all possible values that can occur in $N_n$), and $\Pr(X_i \in V) > 0$ for all $i$.

As in \cite{TV2}, we will divide the non-trivial hyperplanes into $n^2$
classes, since it is then sufficient to show that the sum of $\Pr(A_V)$ over
all $V$ in a particular class is at most $(p^{1/r}+\littleo 1)^n$. 

\begin{definition}[combinatorial dimension]
\label{definition combinatorial dimension} 
Let $\MC D := 
%\{d_{\pm} \in \fraction{1}{n}\cdot \Z: 0 \le d_{\pm} \le n\}$.  
\lt\{ \frac a n: 0 \le a \le n^2, a\in \bb Z\rt\}$.
For any $d_{\pm} \in \MC D$ such that $\dpm \ge
\frac1n$, we define the
\emphasis{combinatorial Grassmannian} $\Gr(\dpm)$ to be the set of all
non-trivial hyperplanes $V$ in $\lt(\Zmodp\rt)^n$ such that 
\begin{equation}\label{combinatorial dimension}
p^{n-\dpm+1/n} < \maximum_{1\le i\le n} \probability(X_i\in V)
\le p^{n-\dpm}.
\end{equation}
For $\dpm = 0$, we define  $\Gr(0)$ to be the set of all
non-trivial hyperplanes such that
\begin{equation*}
\maximum_{1\le i\le n} \probability(X_i\in V) \le p^n.
\end{equation*}
We will refer to $\dpm$ as the \emphasis{combinatorial
dimension} of $V$.  
\end{definition}

Note that $\Gr(\dpm) = \emptyset$ for $\dpm \ge n-1+1/n$ (by
Lemma~\ref{wOdlyz}).  We will consider
hyperplanes $V$ with combinatorial dimension in three main regions: $\dpm$
small, $\dpm$ medium-sized, and $\dpm$ large.  The two lemmas and the
proposition below suffice to prove Theorem~\ref{main theorem}.

\begin{lemma}[Small combinatorial dimension, \cite{KKS}, \cite{TV1}, \cite{TV2}]
\label{smalldim}
For any $\delta >0$ we have
\[
\sum_{\dpm \in \MC D \ \mathrm{s.t.}\ p^{n-\dpm}\le \delta^n}
\quad
\sum_{V \in \Gr(\dpm)} \probability(A_V) \le n \delta^n.
\]
\end{lemma}

In proving Theorem~\ref{main theorem}, we will take $\delta = (p +
\mediumdimconstant \epsilon_0)^{1/r}$ to take care of all small $\dpm$ not
covered by Proposition~\ref{proposition medium} below.  
%Whenever $\delta \ge p$,
%non-trivial hyperplanes with combinatorial dimension $\dpm = 0$ are 
%covered by Lemma~\ref{smalldim}.

\begin{proof}
The reasoning here is the same as in \cite[Lemma~2.3]{TV2}, making use of fact
that $\probability(X_i \in V) \le \maximum_{1\le i \le n} \probability(X_i \in
V) \le p^{n-\dpm} \le \delta^n$.  In particular,
$$\Pr(A_V) \le \sum_{i=1}^n \Pr\lt(\{X_j\}_{1\le j\le n}\setminus\{X_i\} \mbox{
	spans } V\rt)\Pr(X_i \in V),$$
which completes the proof since the summing the right-hand side over all $V$
is at most $n \max_{i} \Pr(X_i \in V)$ (note that an instance of the
vectors $\{X_j\}_{1\le j\le n}\setminus\{X_i\}$ can span at most one
hyperplane).
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}[Large combinatorial dimension, \cite{KKS},\cite{TV1},\cite{TV2}]\label{large dim}
We have
\[
\sum_{\dpm \in \MC D \ \mathrm{s.t.}\ \frac{\largedimconstant}{\sqrt n}\le p^{n-\dpm}}
\quad
\sum_{V \in \Gr(\dpm)} \probability(A_V) \le (p+\littleo{1})^n
\]
\end{lemma}

Here we choose the constant $\largedimconstant$ so that $\largedimconstant \ge
%\frac{\LOEconstant\sqrt{2r}}{q} > 
\LOEconstant p^{-1/n}
\sqrt{\frac{2r}q}$,
where $\LOEconstant$ is the constant from the Littlewood-Offord inequality
(see Lemma~\ref{LOE} in Appendix~\ref{apdxA}) and $q$ is the constant from
Definition~\ref{definition pDqbounded}.

\begin{proof}
Our proof is essentially the same as \cite[Lemma~2.4]{TV2}.  Fix $V \in \Gr(\dpm)$, where $\frac{\largedimconstant}{\sqrt n} \le p^{n-\dpm}$.  Let $\imax$ be an index such that $\Pr(X_\imax \in V) = \max_{1\le i\le n} \Pr(X_i \in V)$.  By assumption,
$$\Pr(X_\imax\in V) \ge p^{n-\dpm+1/n}  \ge \frac{\largedimconstant}{\sqrt n} p^{1/n} \ge \LOEconstant \sqrt{\frac{2r}{qn}}.$$
Noting that $X_\imax\in V$ if and only if $X_\imax$ is orthogonal to the normal vector for $V$, we have by Lemma~\ref{LOE} that
$$\Pr(X_\imax \in V) \le \LOEconstant\sqrt {\frac{r}{qk}},$$
where $k$ is the number of nonzero coordinates in the normal vector to $V$.  Combining the two inequalities above shows that $k\le n/2$.

Thus, we have
\e{
\sum_{\dpm \in \MC D \ \mathrm{s.t.}\ \frac{\largedimconstant}{\sqrt n}\le p^{n-\dpm}}
\quad
\sum_{V \in \Gr(\dpm)} \probability(A_V) &\le \Pr\lt(\lt\{\mbox{\parbox{2in}{there exists a vector $\mathbf v$ with at most $n/2$ nonzero coordinates such that $N_n \cdot \mathbf v = 0$}}\rt\} \rt) \\
%
& \le  (p+\littleo{1})^n \qquad\qquad\qquad\quad \reason{by Lemma~\ref{crank}}
}
(Lemma~\ref{crank} is a natural generalization of \cite[Section~3.1]{KKS}; see
also \cite{Komlosnet}, \cite[Lemma~5.1]{TV1}, and \cite[Lemma~14.10]{Bol}.)
%
%
\begin{comment}
One small change
is that a row vector $X_{\imax}$ should be chosen so that
$\probability(X_{\imax} \in V) = \maximum_{1\le i \le n} \probability(X_i \in
V)$.  Then we can apply a Fourier-analytic analog of the Littlewood-Offord
inequality using $X_{\imax}$ (see Lemma~\ref{LOE} in Appendix~\ref{apdxA}, and also
\cite[Corollary~7.13]{TV4}) to show that the normal vector for $V$ has at most
$n/2$ nonzero coordinates if $n$ is sufficiently large.  Here, we need to
have chosen $Q$ large enough so that the integral approximation in
Inequality~\eqref{approximation condition} (in the proof of Lemma~\ref{LOE})
is valid, which allows us to work entirely in $\Zmodp$.  Once we have shown
that the normal vector for $V$ has at most $n/2$ nonzero coordinates, we can
follow the rest of the proof of \cite[Lemma~2.4]{TV2}, applying
Lemma~\ref{crank} (with $\fxt=0$) in place of \cite[Section~3.1]{KKS}.
(Lemma~\ref{crank} is a natural generalization of \cite[Section~3.1]{KKS}; see
also \cite{Komlosnet}, \cite[Lemma~5.1]{TV1}, and \cite[Lemma~14.10]{Bol}.)
\end{comment}
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[Medium combinatorial dimension estimate]\label{proposition
medium}
Let $0< \epsilon_0$ be a constant much smaller than 1, and let $\dpm \in \MC D$ be such that
$\displaystyle (p + \mediumdimconstant \epsilon_0)^{n/r} <
 p^{n-\dpm} < \frac{\largedimconstant}{\squareroot{n}}$.
Then
\[
\sum_{V\in \Gr(\dpm)} \probability(A_V) \le \littleo{1}^n.
\]
\end{proposition}
\noindent
Here we choose the constant $\mediumdimconstant$ so that $\mediumdimconstant >
\lt(\frac 1{100}+ \mconst \rt)$, where $\mconst$ is some absolute
constant such that $0<\mconst <1$ (the $\frac1{100}$ here comes from $\mubar$
as defined in Section~\ref{S:4.2} below; in \cite{TV2}, it happens that the
constant $\mconst$ is also taken to be $\frac1{100}$).

To prove Theorem~\ref{main theorem}, we can simply combine
Lemma~\ref{smalldim} with $\delta = (p + \mediumdimconstant
\epsilon_0)^{1/r}$, Lemma~\ref{large dim}, and  Proposition~\ref{proposition
medium}.  Thus, proving Proposition~\ref{proposition medium} will complete the
proof of Theorem~\ref{main theorem}.  To prove Proposition~\ref{proposition
medium}, as in \cite[Proposition~2.5]{TV2}, we will separate hyperplanes $V$
of medium combinatorial dimension into two classes, which we will call
\emph{exceptional} and \emph{unexceptional} (see Definition~\ref{def unex}).  See \cite[Section~3]{TV2} for
motivation. The unexceptional case will be proved in the remainder of this
section, and the exceptional case will be proved in
Sections~\ref{S:except}, \ref{S:7}, and \ref{S:8}.

The results in \cite{TV1} and \cite{KKS} were derived using the ideas that we
will use for the unexceptional medium combinatorial dimension case.  The idea
of considering the exceptional case separately in \cite{TV2} (and using tools
from additive combinatorics in the exceptional case) is what lead to
the improvement of Inequality~\eqref{best so far}, which gives a bound of asymptotically $\pfrac34^n$, over the $.999^n$ bound in
\cite{KKS}.


\subsection{Proof of the medium combinatorial dimension}
\label{S:4.2}
 
Before defining exceptional and unexceptional hyperplanes, we will need some new notation. 
%
By assumption, the collection of random variables $\{\alpha_{ij}\}_{1\le i,j\le n}$ is \pDqbounded\ of exponent
$r$ with a constant $\mu=1-p$, with random variables
$\betasuper{\mu}_{ij}$ corresponding to each $\alpha_{ij}$, and with a constant $0< q \le p$ (see Definition~\ref{definition pDqbounded}).
We also define a constant slightly smaller than $\mu$, namely $\displaystyle
\mubar := \mu-\fraction{\epsilon_0}{100}$. 
%
We will let $Y_i := (y_{i,1}, \ldots, y_{i,n}) :=
(\betasuper{\mubar}_{i,1},\ldots,\betasuper{\mubar}_{i,n})$ denote another row
vector that corresponds to the row vector $X_i$ ($\betasuper{\mubar}_{i,j}$
comes from the definition of \pDqbdr).  Also, we will let
\begin{equation}\label{Zstar}
\Zstar_{i,k}:= 
(\overbrace{0,\ldots,0}^{\mbox{\parbox{.5in}{\footnotesize 
$k_{\mathrm{start}}-1$\\ zeroes}}},
y_{i,k_{\mathrm{start}}}, \ldots, y_{i,k_{\mathrm{end}}}, 
\overbrace{0,\ldots, 0}^{\mbox{\parbox{.5in}{\footnotesize 
$n-k_{\mathrm{end}}$\\ zeroes}}}),
\end{equation}
where $k_{\mathrm{start}}:= \floor{(k-1)\fraction{n}{r}}+1$ and 
$k_{\mathrm{end}}:= \floor{k\fraction{n}{r}}$.  The vector
$\Zstar_{i,k}$ can be thought of as the $k$-th segment of $Y_i$ (out of $r$
roughly equal segments).  Note that $Y_i$ and $\Zstar_{i,k}$ are both defined
using $\mubar:=\mu-\fraction{\epsilon_0}{100}$, not $\mu$.  Finally, let
$\epsilon_1$ be a positive constant that is small with respect to
$\epsilon_0$, $\mconst$, and $r$.

\begin{definition}[exceptional and unexceptional]\label{def unex}
Consider a hyperplane $V$ of medium combinatorial dimension (that is, $\dpm$
satisfies the condition in Proposition~\ref{proposition medium}).
%
We say $V$ is \emphasis{unexceptional} if there exists an $i_0$ where $1 \le
i_0 \le n$ and there exists a $k_0$ where $1 \le k_0 \le r$ such that
\begin{equation*}\label{equation unexceptional}
\max_{1\le j\le n}\{\probability(X_{j}\in V)\} < \epsilon_1
\probability(\Zstar_{i_0,k_0} \in V).
\end{equation*}

We say $V$ is \emphasis{exceptional} if for every $i$ where
$1\le i \le n$ and for every $k$ where $1 \le k \le r$ we have
\begin{equation}\label{equation exceptional}
\epsilon_1 \probability(\Zstar_{i,k} \in V) \le \max_{1\le j\le
n}\{\probability(X_{j}\in V)\}.
\end{equation}
In particular, there exists $i_{\mathrm{max}}$ such that
$\Pr(X_{i_{\mathrm{max}}}\in V)=\maximum_{1\le j \le n}\{ \probability(X_j \in
V)\}$; and so if $V$ is exceptional, then 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn exc}
\epsilon_1 \probability(\Zstar_{i_{\mathrm{max}},k} \in V) \le
\probability(X_{i_{\mathrm{max}}}\in V) \qquad \mbox{ for every } k.
\end{equation}
We  will  refer  to $X_{i_{\mathrm{max}}}$ as the \emph{exceptional row} .
\end{definition}
\noindent
Inequality~\eqref{pDqbounded} following Definition~\ref{definition pDqbounded}
can be used to give another relationship between
$\probability(\Zstar_{i_{\mathrm{max}},k} \in V)$ and
$\probability(X_{i_{\mathrm{max}}}\in V)$ that, together with
Inequality~\eqref{eqn exc}, will be of critical importance in
Section~\ref{S:7}.

Proposition~\ref{proposition medium} follows from the two lemmas below, so
long as $\epsilon_1$ is chosen suitably small with respect to $\epsilon_0$,
$\mconst$, and $r$.

\begin{lemma}[Unexceptional space estimate]\label{lemma unexceptional}
We have
\[
\sum_{V\in\Gr(\dpm):\ V\  \mathrm{is\ unexceptional}} \probability(A_V)\le
p^{-\littleo{n}} 2^n \epsilon_1^{ \mconst \epsilon_0 n/r}.
\]
\end{lemma}


\begin{lemma}[Exceptional space estimate] \label{lemma exceptional}
%\label{lemma except}
We have
\[
\sum_{V\in\Gr(\dpm):\ V\  \mathrm{is\ exceptional}} \probability(A_V)\le
n^{-\fraction n{2} + \littleo n}.
\]
\end{lemma}

We will prove Lemma~\ref{lemma unexceptional} in
Section~\ref{S:4.3}, and we will prove Lemma~\ref{lemma
exceptional} in Section~\ref{S:except}.

\subsection{The unexceptional medium combinatorial dimension case}
\label{S:4.3}

The general idea for the case of an unexceptional hyperplane $V$ is to replace
some of the rows $X_i$ in the matrix $\generalmatrix$ with rows that concentrate
more sharply on the subspace $V$.  In the case where the exponent $r=1$,
replacing a row $X_i$ with
$Y_i:=(\betasuper{\mubar}_{i,1},\ldots,\betasuper{\mubar}_{i,n})$ is
successful; however, in the exponent $r= 2$ case, for example, replacing the
entire row results in a bound that is off by an exponential factor.
We solve this problem by replacing $X_i$ with only
half of $Y_i$ (with the other half of the entries being zero).
This idea easily extends to any integer $r \ge 2$ and is the
motivation for defining the vectors $\Zstar_{i,k}$ to have all zeros except
for roughly $n/r$ coordinates, as is done in Equation~\eqref{Zstar}.  The
basic utility of $\Zstar_{i_0,k_0}$ (from Definition~\ref{def unex}) is that
it concentrates more sharply on the unexceptional subspace $V$ than the vector
$X_i$ for any $i$.  

 
Let $\Zstar_{i_0,k_0}$ be the vector from the definition of unexceptional
(Definition~\ref{def unex}) such that $\probability(X_i \in V) < \epsilon_1
\probability(\Zstar_{i_0,k_0} \in V)$ for every $i$, and set
$\Ztilde:=\Zstar_{i_0,j_0}$.  Let $m$ be the closest integer to
$\fraction{\mconst \epsilon_0 n}{r}$, where $\mconst$ is a small positive
absolute constant (for example, in \cite{TV2}, $\mconst$ is taken to be
$\frac1{100}$).  Finally, let $\Ztilde_1, \ldots, \Ztilde_m$ be copies of
$\Ztilde$, independent of each other and of $X_1, \ldots, X_n$.  


\begin{lemma}[see Lemma~4.4 in \cite{TV2}]\label{lem5.8}
Let $B_{V,m}$ be the event that $\Ztilde_1, \ldots, \Ztilde_m$ are linearly
independent and lie in $V$.  Then,
\[
\probability\lt(B_{V,m}\rt) \ge p^{\littleo{n}} \quantityfraction{\maximum_{1\le i\le
n} \probability(X_i \in V)}{\epsilon_1}^m
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The argument follows the same reasoning as \cite[Lemma~4.4]{TV2}, however,
the quantity $2^{\dpm-n}$ in \cite{TV2} should be replaced by $\maximum_{1\le
i\le n} \probability(X_i \in V)$.
%
Details are provided in Appendix~\ref{apdxB}.
\end{proof}

To conclude the proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma unexceptional}, we follow the 
``row-swapping'' argument at the end of \cite[Section~4]{TV2}, with the small
change of bounding $\probability(X_i \in V)$ by $\displaystyle\maximum_{1\le
i\le n} \probability(X_i \in V)$, which we use in place of the quantity
$2^{\dpm-n}$.
Details are provided in Appendix~\ref{apdxB}.


\section{Analyzing the  exceptional medium combinatorial dimension
case}\label{S:except}

The approach for exceptional $V$ in \cite{TV2} is very different from that
used in the unexceptional case or in the large or small combinatorial
dimension cases. Using some powerful tools from additive combinatorics, the
general idea is to put exceptional hyperplanes $V$ in correspondence with a
particular additive structure called a \GAP, and then to show that
the number of the particular \GAP s that arise in this way is exceedingly
small.  The key to this approach is a structure theorem---namely,
\cite[Theorem~5.3]{TV2}. In this section, we state a slightly modified
structure theorem (Theorem~\ref{structure theorem}), and then we show
how to use Theorem~\ref{structure theorem} to prove Lemma~\ref{lemma
exceptional}.  In the beginning of Section~\ref{S:7}, we outline the changes needed to
prove the the structure theorem for our current context, and in
Sections~\ref{S:7} and \ref{S:8} we provide details. 

Before stating the structure theorem, we need some definitions and notation.
A \emph{\gap} of rank $\rnk$ is a set of the form
$$P = \{v_0 + m_1 v_1 + \cdots + m_\rnk: \abs{m_i} \le M_i/2\},$$
where the \emph{basis vectors} $v_0,v_1,\ldots,v_\rnk$ are elements of a
$\Z$-module (here, $\Zmodp$) and where the \emph{dimensions} $M_1,\ldots,
M_\rnk$ are positive integers.  We say that $v_i$ has \emph{corresponding
dimension} $M_i$.  For a given element $a = v_0 + m_1 v_1 + \cdots + m_\rnk$
in $P$, we refer to $m_1,\ldots, m_\rnk$ as \emph{coefficients} for $a$.  A
\gap\ $P$ is \emph{symmetric} if $v_0=0$, and $P$ is \emph{proper} if for each
$a\in P$, the there is a unique $\rnk$-tuple $(m_1,\ldots, m_\rnk)$ with
$\abs{m_i}< M_i/2$ that gives the coefficients for $a$.  
%
If $P$ is proper and symmetric, we define the $P$-norm $\Pnorm{a}$ of an element $a\in P$ to be
$$ \Pnorm{a} := \lt( \sum_{i=1}^\rnk \pfrac{m_i}{M_i}^2 \rt)^{1/2}.$$
%
We will use the notation $m P$, where $m$ is a positive integer, to denote the
set $\{\sum_{i=1}^m x_i : x_i\in P\}$ and the notation $P^m$, where $m$ is a
positive integer, to denote the set $\{\prod_{i=1}^m x_i : x_i \in P\}$.  If
$P$ is a \gap\ of rank $\rnk$, then so is $mP$, while $P^m$, on the other
hand, is a \gap\ of rank at most $\rnk^m$.  Also note that $\abs{mP} \le m^\rnk
\abs P$ and that $\abs{P^m} \le \abs{P}^m$. 

Let $ V$ be an exceptional hyperplane of  medium combinatorial dimension in $
\Gr(\dpm)$ and let  $ \Xex= (\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n)$ be the exceptional row
(here we are using $\alpha_j$ as shorthand for $\alpha_{\imax,j}$).  Let
$(\betasupermu_1,\ldots,\betasupermu_n)$ be the row of  random variables
corresponding to $\Xex$ from the definition of \pDqbounded\ of exponent $r$,
and let $b_{j,s}$ with $1\le j\le n$ and $1\le s\le \ell_j$ be the values
taken by $\betasupermu_j$ (see Equation~\eqref{betasuper} for the definition
of $\betasupermu_j$).

Given an exceptional hyperplane $V$, there exists a representation of the form 
\[
V =\{(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \in (\Zmodp)^n \ : \ %\mathrm{ s.t.}\
 x_1 a_1 + x_2a_2 +
\cdots + x_na_n =0 \}
\]
for some elements $ a_1, a _2, \ldots, a_n \in \Zmodp $.  We will call $a_1,
a_2, \ldots, a_n $ the  \emph{defining coordinates} of $V$.  
%
Finally, let $\tilde a_j:= \bjsj a_j$.  We will
refer to $(\tilde a_1,\ldots,\tilde a_n)$ as the \emph{scaled defining
coordinates of $V$} .  Note that once $\imax$ is fixed, so are the elements
$\bjsj$.  We should also note that the choice of $\bjsj$
among $b_{j,s}$ for $1\le s \le \ell_j$ is arbitrary---since $\betasupermu_j$
takes the values $b_{j,s}$ each with probability at least $q$, any value of
$s$ will do; and so we have taken $s=1$ for convenience.

Let $\bb H$ denote the \emph{highly rational numbers} , that is, those numbers in
$\Zmodp$ of the form $a/b \pmod Q$ where $a,b$ are integers such that $\abs{a}, \abs b
\le n^{o(n)}$ and $b \ne 0$.  The highly rational
numbers were defined in \cite[Section~8]{TV2}, and we will need a small
extension for the current paper, due to the fact that we are using the scaled
defining coordinates of $V$ instead of simply the defining coordinates of $V$.
If we were to assume that $\bjsj$ was an $O(1)$ integer for all $j$ and that
every possible value taken by $\alpha_{ij}$ was an $O(1)$ integer for all
$i,j$, then we could still use the same definition of highly rational as in
\cite{TV2}. However, if there is a $\bjsj$ or an entry $\alpha_{ij}$ in the
matrix $\generalmatrix$ that ever takes an irrational value, then when we pass
to $\Zmodp$ using Lemma~\ref{reduction theorem} we have to account for values
possibly on the order of $Q$ (see Remark~\ref{sizeofQ}), and the highly
rational numbers are not sufficient for this task.  We can overcome this
difficulty by extending to the highly $T$-rational numbers, which
contain the highly rational numbers along with all the values in a structured
set $T$ (described below). 
%(a set with cardinality $n^{o(n)}$ that has the additive structure
%described below and contains the
%$\bjsj$, the set $\{-1,0,1\}$, and all the values taken by the
%$\alpha_{ij}$).  
We will now give a rigorous definition the highly $T$-rational
numbers.

Let $T$ be a \gap\ in $\Zmodp$ with rank $O(1)$ and having cardinality at most
$n^{o(n)}$.  As in the definition of \pDqbounded\ of exponent $r$
(Definition~\ref{definition pDqbounded}), we will take $\setofvalues$ to be
the \gap\ containing all possible values in $\Zmodp$ taken by the random
variables $\alpha_{ij}$ that are the entries of $\generalmatrix$; thus, by
assumption $\abs\sov \le n^{o(n)}$.  By the definition of \pDqbdr, we know
that all of the random variables $\betasupermu_{ij}$ take values in a set with
cardinality $O(1)$.  Thus, there is a symmetric \gap\ $T$ with rank $O(1)$ and
cardinality $\abs T\le n^{o(n)}$ such that $T$ contains $S$, such that $T$
contains the set $\{-1,0,1\}$, and such that $T$ contains all the values taken
by the $\betasupermu_{ij}$.  To construct $T$ from $S$, one can, for example,
add each distinct value taken by a $\betasupermu_{ij}$ as a new basis vector
$v'$ with corresponding dimension $M':= 3$ (say).

A \emph{highly $T$-rational number} $h$ is any element of $\Zmodp$ of the form
$a/b$, where $a,b \in n^{o(n)} T^{O(1)}$.  Note that therefore, the
cardinality of the \hsr\ numbers is at most $(n^{d o(n)} \abs{T})^{O(1)} =
n^{o(n)}$, where $d=O(1)$ is the rank of $T$ (here we used the fact that
$\abs{T} \le n^{o(n)}$).

\begin{theorem}[Structure Theorem]\label{structure theorem}
There is a constant $C=C(\epmo,\epsilon_0,\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2,q,r,\mu)$ such
that the following holds.  Let $V$ be an exceptional hyperplane and let
$\tilde a_1, \ldots, \tilde a_n$ be its  scaled defining coordinates (as
described above).  Then there exist integers

and nonzero elements $v_1,\ldots, v_\rnk  \in\Zmodp$ such that the following

\end{itemize}

",/home/shufan/que_tex/RandMatrix.tex,theorem + \emph{},"
Let p be a positive constant such that 0< p<1, let r be a positive
integer constant, and let S be a  in the complex numbers with rank
O(1) (independent of n) and with cardinality at most S ≤
n^o(n).

Let  be an n by n matrix with entries α_jk, each
of which is an independent random variable taking values in S. If the collection of random variables
{α_jk}_1≤ j,k≤ n  is  of exponent r, then

    ()
     (p^1/r +1) ^n.





In the motivating
examples of Section <ref> (excluding Corollary <ref>), we
discussed the case where the entries of the matrix are i.i.d.; however, in
general the distributions of the entries are allowed to differ (and even
depend on n), so long as the entries all take values in the same structured
set S described above.

The condition that S has additive structure seems to be an artifact of the
proof (in particular, at certain points in the proof of Theorem <ref>, we need the set {∑_j=1^n x_j : x_j ∈ S 
j} to have cardinality at most n^o(n)).  The easiest way to guarantee
that S has the required structure is to assume that the set of values taken
by all the α_jk has cardinality at most O(1), and this is the
approach we take for the corollaries in Section <ref>, since it
also makes it easy to demonstrate that the collection of entries is .



Note that the constants μ,, must be such that the right-hand side of Equation (<ref>) is non-negative.  It turns out for
the proof of Theorem <ref> that we will need slightly more.

At one point in the proof, we will apply Lemma <ref>, for which we
we must assume that there exists a very small constant >0 such that E(e(_jk t))>  for all t and for all _jk
used in the definition of  of exponent r.  Of course, if the
expectations are not strictly larger than , we can simply reduce μ
by ϵ_-1>0.  Then, since we are assuming 1-μ=p, we clearly have
that all the α_jk are (p+ϵ_-1)-bounded of exponent r
(by using μ-_jk instead of _jk) and we
have that E(e(μ-_jk t))> >0.  Since
Theorem <ref> would thus yield a bound of
((p+ϵ_-1)^1/r + o(1))^n for every ϵ_-1>0, we can
conclude a bound of (p^1/r + o(1))^n by letting  tend to 0.
Thus, without loss of generality, we will assume that E(e(_jk t))> for all t and for all _jk
used in the definition of  of exponent r.  






§ SOME COROLLARIES OF THEOREM <REF>
 


In this section, we will state a number of corollaries of Theorem <ref>, starting with short proofs of Inequalities (<ref>),
(<ref>), and (<ref>).  The two most interesting results in
this section will be more general: first (in Section <ref>), we will
show an exponential bound on the singularity probability for a matrix with
independent entries
each a symmetric random variable taking values in ⊂
C, where ≤ O(1) and assuming that each entry takes the value 0 with probability 1-μ; and
second (in Section <ref>), we will describe a similar (and
sometimes better) bound when the condition that the random variables have
symmetric distributions is replaced
with the assumption that no entry takes a value with probability greater than
p.  In the first case, the bound will depend only the value of μ, and in
the second case, the bound will depend only on the value of p.
In Section <ref>, we will show an exponential bound on the singularity
probability for an n by n  matrix with = o(n) fixed rows containing
small integer values and with the remaining rows containing independent random
variables taking values in S⊂ C, where S≤ O(1) (this is
similar to Corollary <ref>, which is proved in
Section <ref>).  Finally, in Section <ref>, we will prove an
exponential upper bound on the probability that a random integer matrix has a
rational eigenvalue.

In each corollary, we will use the definition of  of exponent 1
and of exponent 2.  The definition of  of exponent 2 is
particularly useful, since then the absolute value on the left-hand side of
Inequality (<ref>) is automatically dealt with; however, when μ
is small (for example whenever μ≤ 1/2), one can get better bounds by
using  of exponent 1.  We have not yet found an example where the
best possible bound from Theorem <ref> is found by using
 of an exponent higher than 2.



 §.§ Proving Inequalities (<ref>), (<ref>), and
(<ref>)


To prove Inequality (<ref>), we note for 
0 ≤μ≤1/2 that (using the definition in
Equation (<ref>) of ) 

    𝔼(e( t)) = 1 - μ + μcos(2π t),


and thus  is (1-μ)-bounded of exponent 1
(i.e., take :=), and so Inequality (<ref>)
follows from Theorem <ref>.


To prove Inequality (<ref>), we note for 1/2≤μ≤ 1 that 

    𝔼(e( t)) = 1 - μ + μcos( 2π t)≤2μ+14 +(1-μ)cos(2π t) + 2μ-14cos(4π t)


(the inequality above may be checked by squaring both sides and expanding as
polynomials in cos(2π t)).  Thus, we can take 

	:= 
	+2     2μ-1/8 

	-2     2μ-1/8 

	+1     1-μ/2 

	-1     1-μ/2 

	0     2μ+1/4
	

to see that  is (2μ+1/4)-bounded of exponent 1, and so Inequality (<ref>) follows
from Theorem <ref>.

To prove Inequality (<ref>), we note for 0 ≤μ≤ 1 that 

    𝔼(e( t))^2 = 1 - μ + μcos( 2π t)^2 
    = 1-2μ+3/2μ^2 +2(1-μ)μcos(2π t) + μ^22cos(4π
    t).


Thus, we can take 

	:= 
	+2     μ^2/4 

	-2     μ^2/4 

	+1     (1-μ)μ

	-1     (1-μ)μ

	0      1-2μ+3/2 μ^2
	

to see that  is (1-2μ+3/2μ^2
)-bounded of exponent 2, and so Inequality (<ref>) follows
from Theorem <ref>.




 §.§ Matrices with entries having symmetric distributions


In this subsection, we will prove a singularity bound for an n by n matrix
 for which each entry is a symmetric discrete random variable
taking the value 0 with probability 1-μ.


Let  be a set of complex numbers with cardinality ≤ O(1).
If  is an n by n matrix in which each entry is an independent
symmetric complex random variable taking values in S and taking the
value 0 with probability 1-μ, then

	() ≤
		(1-μ+ o(1))^n     0≤μ≤1/2 

		(2μ+1/4 + o(1))^n    1/2≤μ≤1
		

		(√(1-2μ+3/2μ^2) +o(1))^n    0≤μ≤1.
	

In particular, the same upper bounds as in Inequalities (<ref>),
(<ref>), and (<ref>) (which are shown in Figure <ref>) apply to the singularity probability for .



Let α_ij be an entry of .  Since α_ij is symmetric
and takes the value 0 with probability 1-μ, we may write α_ij =
_ijη_ij, where _ij is an independent
copy of  as defined in Equation (<ref>) and η_ij is a random variable that shares no values
with -η_ij.  This description of α_ij was inspired by
<cit.>, and it allows us to condition on η_ij and then use the
remaining randomness in _ij to get a bound on the singularity
probability.  In particular,

	()    = ∑_(c_ij) 
	( | {η_ij =c_ij}) ({η_ij
	=c_ij}),

where the sum runs over all (n^2)-tuples (c_ij)_1≤ i,j≤ n of
possible values taken by random variables η_ij.  Since
∑_(c_ij)({η_ij =c_ij}) =1, we can
complete the proof by proving an exponential bound on ( | {η_ij =c_ij}), and we will use Theorem <ref> for this task.  

Consider the random matrix , where the i,j entry is the random
variable c_ij_ij for some constant c_ij.  Note that the
entries of  take values in S, a set with cardinality O(1), and let
 be the map from Lemma <ref>, which lets us pass to
the case where  has entries in .  Defining θ_ij:=
2π(c_ij), we compute

	    E e((c_ij_ij) t) 
	= 1-μ+ μcos(θ_ijt) 
	

	       ≤
1-μ+ μcos(θ_ijt)
	    0≤μ≤1/2, 


2μ+1/4 +(1-μ)cos(θ_ijt) +
2μ-14cos(2θ_ij t)
	    1/2≤μ≤1,  


(0pt11pt 
1-2μ+3/2 μ^2 +2(1-μ)μcos(θ_ij t) +
μ^2/2cos(2θ_ij t) )^1/2
	    0≤μ≤1.


We have thus shown that the entries of  are

	   (1-μ)
	0≤μ≤1/2,

	
	   (2μ+1/4) 
		1/2 ≤μ≤1, 
	
	   (1-2μ+3/2μ^2) 
		0≤μ≤1.	

Applying Theorem <ref> completes the proof.  

Corollary <ref> is tight for 0≤μ≤1/2, since the
probability of a row of all zeroes occurring is (1-μ +o(1))^n; however,
for any specific case, Theorem <ref> can usually prove better
upper bounds than those given by Corollary <ref>. 


For example, consider the case of a matrix  with each entry an
independent copy of the symmetric random variable

	:= 

	+2     μ/4 

	-2     μ/4 

	+1     μ/4 

	-1     μ/4 

	0      1-μ


 
For  as defined above, we have

	() ≤
	(1-μ+ o(1) )^n     0 ≤μ≤16/25

	(√(1-2μ+5/4 μ^2) + o(1) )^n     0≤μ≤1.
	




By the definition of  we have

	E e(t) = 1-μ+μ/2 cos(2πt) +μ/2
	cos(4πt),     0≤μ≤16/25

(i.e., the right-hand side of the equation above is non-negative for such
μ), which proves the first bound.  

Also, we have

	E e(t)^2    = 1-2μ+5/4μ^2 +
	(μ-3/4μ^2) cos(2πt) + (μ-7/8μ^2)
	cos(4πt) 

   3in0pt+ μ^2/4 cos(6πt) + μ^2/8 cos(8πt)

for 0≤μ≤1, which proves the second bound.

   (1-2μ+5μ^2/4 + o(1))^n    from a two-row
dependency



The results of Corollary <ref> and the corresponding lower bounds are
shown in Figure <ref>, and one should note that the upper bounds are
substantially better than those guaranteed by Corollary <ref>.




 §.§ Random  matrices with entries having arbitrary distributions



A useful feature of the definition of  of exponent 2 is that it
lets one bound the singularity probability of matrices with independent discrete
random variables that are asymmetric. 


Let p be a constant such that 0<p≤ 1 and let ⊂ C be a set
with cardinality ≤ O(1).
If  is an n by n matrix with independent random entries taking
values in S such that for any entry α, we have max_x (α =
x)≤ p, then

    ()≤ (√(p) + o(1))^n.



We will need the following slightly more general corollary in
Section <ref>. For a set A and an integer m, we will use the
notation mA :={∑_j=1^m a_j : a_j ∈ A} and A^m:= {∏_j=1^m
a_j : a_j ∈ A}. 


Let p be a constant such that 0<p≤ 1, let ⊂ C be a set
with cardinality ≤ O(1), and let X_n be an n by n matrix
with fixed, non-random entries in n^o(n)(S ∪{-1,0,1})^O(1).
If  is an n by n matrix with independent random entries taking
values in S such that for any entry α, we have max_x (α =
x)≤ p, then

    (X_n + )≤ (√(p) + o(1))^n.


Note that that Corollary <ref> implies Corollary <ref> by
taking X_n to be the matrix of all zeroes. 


Let α_ij be an entry in .  Our goal is to describe
α_ij in a two-step random process, condition on one of the steps, and
then use the randomness in the other step to bound the singularity
probability.  The conditioning approach is the same as that used in the
symmetric case (Corollary <ref>) and was inspired by
<cit.>.  The conditioning argument is useful since some entries of
the random matrix may take some values with very small probability (i.e.
probability less than any constant);  recall that while the entries of the
random matrix always take values in a fixed set S of cardinality O(1), the
distributions of those random variables within S are allowed to
vary with n.  (Note that making use of Remark <ref> would provide an
alternate way of dealing with entries that take some values with very small
probability.)


Say that α_ij takes the values v_1,…,v_t
with probabilities ϱ_1,…, ϱ_t, respectively, where
ϱ_1≥ϱ_2 ≥⋯≥ϱ_t.  Define new random variables
η_ijk such that for some i_0
and i_1, the values taken by η_ijk are v_i_0,
v_i_0+1,…,v_i_0 + i_1 with corresponding probabilities
ϱ_i_0/p_k,
ϱ_i_0+1/p_k,…,ϱ_i_0 + i_1/p_k, where p_k:=
∑_i=1^i_1ϱ_i_0 + i.  Thus, we can write
 
	α_ij = 
	η_ij1      p_1 

	η_ij2      p_2 

	⋮    ⋮

	η_ijℓ      p_ℓ.
	

Furthermore, the η_ijk can be constructed so that p_k ≤ p for
every k, so that p/2 ≤ p_k for 1≤ k ≤ℓ -1, and so that no two
η_ijk with different k's ever take the same value.  


There are two cases to consider for the technical reason that p_ℓ is not
necessarily bounded below by a constant.  Let ϵ>0 be
a very small constant, so for example p/2> ϵ.  Case 1 is when ϵ≤ p_ℓ, and in this case each
p_k is bounded below by ϵ and above  by p.
We will consider Case 1 first and then discuss the
small changes needed to deal with Case 2.

As in the proof of Corollary <ref>, we will
condition on the values taken by the η_ijk in order to prove a
bound on the singularity probability.  We have that 

    (X_n + ) = ∑_(c_ijk)(X_n +  | {η_ijk=c_ijk}) ({η_ijk=c_ijk}),

where the sum runs over all possible values (c_ijk) that the η_ijk
can take.  Thus, it is sufficient to prove a bound on the singularity
probability for the random matrix X_n + which has random entries

	+α_ij = 
	+c_ij1      p_1 

	+c_ij2      p_2 

	⋮    ⋮

	+c_ijℓ      p_ℓ,
	

where  and the c_ijk are constants.

Note the entries of X_n+ take values in , a  with rank
O(1) and cardinality at most n^o(n), and let  be the
map from Lemma <ref>, which lets us pass to the case where
X_n+ has entries in .  Defining θ_ijk:=
2π(c_ijk) and letting α'_ij be an i.i.d. copy of α_ij, we compute

	E e((+α_ij) t)^2 
	   =E e
	(0pt11pt
	(+α_ij--α_ij') t) 
	=E e
	(0pt11pt
	(α_ij-α_ij') t) 

	

	   = ∑_k=1^ℓp_k^2 + 2 ∑_1≤k_1<k_2≤ℓ p_k_1 p_k_2
	cos((θ_ijk_1-θ_ijk_2)t).

Thus, +α_ij is (∑_k=1^ℓ p_k^2)-bounded of
exponent 2 (using the constant q = ϵ^2 in Definition <ref>, so q does not depend on n). Given that 0<p_k≤ p for every
k, it is not hard to show that ∑_k=1^ℓ p_k^2  ≤ p< p+ϵ,
and so from Definition <ref>, we see that the collection
{+α_ij: α_ij p_ℓ≥ϵ} is (p + ϵ)-bounded of
exponent 2.  We are thus finished with Case 1.

Case 2 is when the decomposition of α_ij given in Equation (<ref>) has
p_ℓ < ϵ.  In this case we need to modify Equation (<ref>)
slightly, deleting η_ijℓ and replacing η_ij(ℓ-1) with a new
variable η_ij(ℓ-1)' that takes all the values previously taken by
η_ijℓ and by η_ij(ℓ-1) with the appropriate probabilities.  
Thus, in Case 2, we have that p/2≤ p_k < p+ϵ for all 1≤ k≤ℓ -1, showing that each p_k is bounded below by a constant and is
bounded above by p+ϵ (here we are using p_ℓ -1 to denote
the probability that α_ij draws a value from the random variable
η_ij(ℓ-1)').

For Case 2, we use exactly the same reasoning as in Case 1 above to show that 
such entries of X_n+ are (∑_k=1^ℓ-1 p_k^2)-bounded of
exponent 2 (using the constant q=ϵ^2<p^2/4 in
Definition <ref>, so q does not depend on n). Noting
that ∑_k=1^ℓ-1 p_k^2<p+ϵ and using
Definition <ref>, we see that the collection
{+α_ij: α_ij p_ℓ < ϵ} is (p + ϵ)-bounded of
exponent 2.

Combining Case 1 and Case 2, we have that the collection
{+α_ij} is (p + ϵ)-bounded of exponent
2, and so by and by Theorem <ref> we have that (X_n+) 

≤(√(p +ϵ) + o(1))^n.

The constant ϵ>0 was chosen arbitrarily, and so letting
ϵ tend to zero, we get that 

    (X_n+ |
    {η_ijk=c_ijk}) ≤( √(p) + o(1))^n.







 §.§ Partially random matrices 



In this subsection, we prove a bound on the singularity probability for partly
random matrices where many rows are deterministic.

  
Let p be a real constant between 0 and 1, let K be a large positive
constant, and let S⊂ C be a set of complex numbers having
cardinality S ≤ K.  Let  be an n by n matrix in which
 rows contain fixed, non-random integers between -K and K and where
the other rows contain entries that are independent random variables taking
values in S.  If ≤ o(n), if the  fixed rows are linearly
independent, and if for every random entry α, we have max_x (α
= x) ≤ p, then

    ()≤(√(p) + o(1))^n-.



Corollary <ref> applies
to partly random matrices with = o(n) fixed, non-random rows containing
integers bounded by a constant and with random entries taking at most O(1)
values in the complex numbers.   Corollary <ref>, on the other
hand, holds with the fixed entries also allowed to take values in the complex
numbers and gives a sligtly better bound, but additionally requires ≤
O(ln n) (which is far smaller in general than o(n)).  Proving
Corollary <ref> requires mirroring the entire argument used to
prove the main theorem (Theorem <ref>) in the case where 
rows contain fixed, non-random entires, and we discuss this argument in
Section <ref>.  Proving Corollary <ref>, however, can be
done directly from Theorem <ref>, as we will show below.  First,
we will state a generalization of Corollary <ref>.

  
Let p be a real constant between 0 and 1, let K be a large positive
constant, and let S⊂ C be a set of complex numbers having
cardinality S ≤ K.   Let  be an n by n matrix in which
 rows contain fixed, non-random integers between -K and K and where
the other rows contain entries that are independent random variables taking
values in S. If ≤ o(n), if the fixed rows have co-rank k, 
and if for every random entry α, we have max_x (α =
x) ≤ p, then

    ( >k)≤(√(p) + o(1))^n-.




To obtain Corollary <ref> from Corollary <ref>, find
a collection C of -k linearly independent rows among the
deterministic rows. Replace the rest of the deterministic rows with a
collection C' of rows containing integer values between -K and K
such that C' is linearly independent from C. Finally, apply
Corollary <ref> to the new partially random matrix whose
deterministic rows are from C ∪ C', thus proving
Corollary <ref>. 



By reordering the rows and columns, we may write

    = ([ A B; C D ]),

where A is an  by  non-random invertible matrix, B is an
 by n- non-random matrix, C is an n- by  random
matrix, and D is an n- by n- random matrix.  Note that 
is singular if and only if there exists a vector 𝐯 such that 𝐯 =0.  Let 𝐯_1 be the first  coordinates of 𝐯 and let 𝐯_2 be the remaining n- coordinates.  Then 𝐯 = 0 if and only if

    A 𝐯_1 + B 𝐯_2 = 0, 
    
    C 𝐯_1 + D 𝐯_2 = 0.

Since A is invertible, these two equations are satisfied if and only if
(-CA^-1B + D) 𝐯_2 = 0, that is, if and only if the random matrix
-CA^-1B + D is singular.  

We want to show that every entry that can appear in -CA^-1B is an element
of .  By the cofactor formula for A^-1, we know that the i,j
entry of A^-1 is (-1)^i+j( A_ij)/ A, where A_ij is the
-1 by -1 matrix formed by deleting the i-th row and j-th
column of A.  Thus, A^-1 = 1/ AA, where the i,j
entry of A is (-1)^i+j A_ij.  By the volume formula for
the determinant, we know that A is at most the product of the
lengths of the row vectors of A; and thus A≤ n^o(n) (here
we need that A has integer entries between -K and K, where K is a
constant, and that ≤ o(n)).  Similarly, we have A_ij≤
n^o(n).  Every entry of A is thus in n^o(n){-1,0,1}, every
entry of C is in S, and every entry of B is in O(1){-1,0,1}; thus,
every entry of -CA B is an element of n^o(n)(S∪{-1,0,1}). 


Conditioning on the values taken by all the entries in C, we have

	()    = (-CA^-1B + D)
	

	    = ∑_(c_ij) (-CA^-1B + D | C= (c_ij))
	(C = (c_ij)), 

where the sum runs over all possible matrices (c_ij) that
C can produce.   Considering the entries in C=(c_ij) to be fixed (note
that A and B are fixed by assumption), we now need to bound 

    (-(c_ij)A^-1B + D )
    =(-(c_ij)AB + ( A) D ).

Note that every entry of -(c_ij)AB is an element of 
and that the random matrix ( A) D has entries that take values in the
fixed set {( A) s: s∈ S} having cardinality O(1).  Thus, by
Corollary <ref>, we have that 

    (-(c_ij)AB + ( A) D ) ≤ (√(p) +
    o(1))^n-.

Plugging this bound back into Equation (<ref>) completes the proof.




 §.§ Integer matrices and rational eigenvalues


Let η_k be the random variable taking the values -k, -k+1, …, k-1,
k each with equal probability, and let M_n be the n by n matrix where
each entry is an independent copy of η_k.  In <cit.>, Martin and
Wong show that for any ϵ >0, 
    (M_n ) ≤c(n,ϵ)/ k^1-ϵ,
 


where c(n,ϵ) is a constant depending on n and ϵ.  (One
goal in <cit.> is to study this bound as k goes to ∞ while
n is fixed, which is why c(n,ϵ) is allowed to depend on n.)  


Below, we prove a similar result for random integer matrices with
entries between -k and k (with k fixed), where we allow each entry to
have a different (independent) distribution and we also allow the
distributions to be very general.


Fix a positive integer k, and let  be a random integer matrix with
independent entries, each of which takes values in the set
{-k,-k+1,…,k-1, k}.  
Let c be a constant such that for every entry α,  we have
max_-k≤ x≤ k(α =x) ≤ c/k.
Then 

    () ≤(c/k + o(1))^n/2,

where the o(1) term goes to zero as n goes to ∞.



For example, in the case where each independent entry has the uniform
distribution on {-k,-k+1,…,k-1, k} (as in <cit.>), one can
set c=1/2 in the corollary above.


The proof given below follows the same outline as the main theorem of
<cit.>, with Corollary <ref> replacing an appeal to
<cit.>.  

The characteristic polynomial for  is monic with integer coefficients,
and thus the only possible rational eigenvalues are integers (by the rational
roots theorem).  Every eigenvalue of  has absolute value at most nk
(see <cit.>); thus, the only possible integer eigenvalues are
between -nk and nk.  

The matrix  has λ as an eigenvalue if and only if -
λ I is singular (where I is the n by n identity matrix).  By
Corollary <ref> (with = 0), we have

    ( - λ I ) ≤( √(c/k) +
    o(1))^n.

Using the union bound, we have

	()    =
	
	(-λI  )

	   ≤∑_λ= -nk^nk  (- λI ) 

	   ≤(2nk +1) ( √(c/k) + o(1))^n

	   ≤( c/k + o(1))^n/2.







§ RANDOM MATRICES WITH COMPLEX ENTRIES:
A REDUCTION TECHNIQUE




The original work on discrete random matrices in <cit.> is
concerned with matrices having integer entries, which can also be viewed as
matrices with entries in  where Q is a very large prime.  In this
section we show that  one can  pass from a  (random) matrix with entries in
C to one with entries in  where Q is an arbitrarily large
prime number, all without affecting the probability that the determinant is
zero, thanks to the following lemma. 



Let  be a finite subset of C.  There exist infinitely many 
primes Q such that there is a ring homomorphism :[] → 
satisfying the following two properties:


  (i)  the map  is injective on , and

  (ii)  for any n by n matrix (s_ij)_1≤ i,j≤ n with entries s_ij∈ S,
we have 
    (0pt14pt(s_ij)_1≤ i,j≤ n) = 0     (0pt14pt((s_ij))_1≤ i,j≤ n)=0.





In order to apply this lemma, let us point out that the proof of
Theorem <ref>, which is discussed in Sections <ref> through
<ref>, works exclusively in ; though at various points, it is
necessary to assume Q is extremely large with respect to n and various
constants.  For this paper, S will be the set of  all  possible values taken
by the random variables α_jk.  Recall that by assumption,
≤ n^o(n), so in particular, S is finite.





When we apply Lemma <ref>, we will take Q>exp(exp(Cn))
for some constant C in order for Freiman-type theorems such as
<cit.> (which is restated in Theorem <ref> below) to
apply, and we will also choose Q large enough so that the integral
approximation in Inequality (<ref>)
holds and so that Q is large with respect to various constants.  One should
note that while Q can be taken arbitrarily large with respect to n, we
cannot choose Q so that it is arbitrarily large with respect to (s)
for all s∈, where  is the set of all
values that could appear in the given random matrix.  For example, if √(2)∈, then the smallest positive integer representative for (√(2)) must be larger than √(Q) (since ((√(2)))^2 = 2 in
).  Finally, if we were in a situation where ⊂ Q, then
we could avoid using Lemma <ref> altogether by clearing
denominators to pass to Z and then take Q≈exp(exp(Cn)), as is
done in <cit.>.  

Lemma <ref> is a corollary of the main theorem of
<cit.> and its proof is  given in detail in <cit.>.
The paper  <cit.> also contains  further applications of the method
used to prove Lemma <ref>, for example proving a sum-product
result for the complex numbers and proving a Szemerédi-Trotter-type result
for the complex numbers, where the applications follow from the analogous
results for Z/Q where Q is a prime (see <cit.>).  The results
in <cit.>, including Lemma <ref>, all go through with
the complex numbers being replaced by any characteristic zero integral domain.
Thus, the results stated in Sections <ref>, <ref>, and
<ref> above for the complex numbers C also all go through
with C replaced by any characteristic zero integral domain.  For
example, Corollary <ref> becomes

 Let p be a constant such that 0<p≤ 1 and let D be a
characteristic zero integral domain.  Let S⊂ D have cardinality S≤ O(1).  If  is an n by n matrix with
independent random entries, each taking values in S, such that for
every entry α, we have max_x (α = x)≤ p, then 
    ()≤ (√(p) + o(1))^n.
 




§ PROOF OF THE MAIN THEOREM (THEOREM <REF>)


The proof of Theorem <ref> very closely follows the proof of
<cit.>.  Our goal is to highlight
the changes that need to be made to generalize the proof in <cit.>
so that it proves Theorem <ref>.  A reader interested in the
details of the proof of Theorem <ref> should read this paper
alongside of <cit.>.  Throughout the proof, we will assume that n is
sufficiently large, and we will allow constants hidden in the o(·) and
O(·) notation to depend on the constants ϵ_-1, ϵ_0,
ϵ_1, ϵ_2, p,q,r, , ,
, and .  The constants ϵ_-1, ϵ_0,
ϵ_1, ϵ_2 should be considered very small, and, in fact, we will
let them tend to zero to prove the full strength of  Theorem <ref>.  The constants p,q,r, , ,
, and  can be thought of as absolute, except possibly
for depending on each other.



 §.§ Definitions and preliminaries


Given an n by n matrix  with entries α_ij, we
assume that the collection of independent random variables
{α_ij}_1≤ i,j≤ n is  for some fixed constants
p, q, and r (here, q is the constant from Definition <ref> which is independent of n).  We also assume that each α_ij takes at most
n^o(n) distinct values.  Using Lemma <ref>, we may
assume without loss of generality that each α_ij takes values in
 for some very large prime Q.  The entirety of the proof will take
place over the field , and so terminology such as “linearly
independent”, “span”, “dimension”, “rank” and so forth will always be
with respect to the field .

Let X_i:=(α_i,1,…,α_i,n) denote the i-th row of
.  We note that  has determinant zero if and
only if there is a linear dependency among the rows X_i.  It has been shown
(see 

<cit.> and also <cit.>) that the dominant contribution to
the singularity probability comes from the X_i spanning a hyperplane (of
dimension n-1).  In particular,

	() = p^-o(n) 
	∑_V a non-trivial_hyperplane in	()^n (A_V),

where A_V denotes the event that X_1,…, X_n span V, and
non-trivial means that V contains the origin, V is spanned by vectors in
S^n (where S is the set of all possible values that can occur in N_n), and (X_i ∈ V) > 0 for all i.

As in <cit.>, we will divide the non-trivial hyperplanes into n^2
classes, since it is then sufficient to show that the sum of (A_V) over
all V in a particular class is at most (p^1/r+ 1)^n. 


 
Let D := 

{a/n: 0 ≤ a ≤ n^2, a∈ Z}.
For any d_±∈ D such that ≥1/n, we define the
combinatorial Grassmannian () to be the set of all
non-trivial hyperplanes V in ()^n such that 

    p^n-+1/n < _1≤ i≤ n(X_i∈ V)
    ≤ p^n-.

For = 0, we define  (0) to be the set of all
non-trivial hyperplanes such that

    _1≤ i≤ n(X_i∈ V) ≤ p^n.

We will refer to  as the combinatorial
dimension of V.  


Note that () = ∅ for ≥ n-1+1/n (by
Lemma <ref>).  We will consider
hyperplanes V with combinatorial dimension in three main regions: 
small,  medium-sized, and  large.  The two lemmas and the
proposition below suffice to prove Theorem <ref>.



For any δ >0 we have

    ∑_∈ D  s.t. p^n-≤δ^n  ∑_V ∈()(A_V) ≤ n δ^n.



In proving Theorem <ref>, we will take δ = (p +
ϵ_0)^1/r to take care of all small  not
covered by Proposition <ref> below.  





The reasoning here is the same as in <cit.>, making use of fact
that (X_i ∈ V) ≤_1≤ i ≤ n(X_i ∈
V) ≤ p^n-≤δ^n.  In particular,

    (A_V) ≤∑_i=1^n ({X_j}_1≤ j≤ n∖{X_i} V)(X_i ∈ V),

which completes the proof since the summing the right-hand side over all V
is at most n max_i(X_i ∈ V) (note that an instance of the
vectors {X_j}_1≤ j≤ n∖{X_i} can span at most one
hyperplane).




We have

    ∑_∈ D  s.t. /√(n)≤ p^n-  ∑_V ∈()(A_V) ≤ (p+1)^n



Here we choose the constant  so that ≥
 p^-1/n√(2r/q),
where  is the constant from the Littlewood-Offord inequality
(see Lemma <ref> in Appendix <ref>) and q is the constant from
Definition <ref>.


Our proof is essentially the same as <cit.>.  Fix V ∈(), where /√(n)≤ p^n-.  Let  be an index such that (X_∈ V) = max_1≤ i≤ n(X_i ∈ V).  By assumption,

    (X_∈ V) ≥ p^n-+1/n≥/√(n) p^1/n≥√(2r/qn).

Noting that X_∈ V if and only if X_ is orthogonal to the normal vector for V, we have by Lemma <ref> that

    (X_∈ V) ≤√(r/qk),

where k is the number of nonzero coordinates in the normal vector to V.  Combining the two inequalities above shows that k≤ n/2.

Thus, we have

∑_∈D  s.t. /√(n)≤p^n-
  ∑_V ∈() (A_V)    ≤({} ) 


    ≤(p+1)^n               by Lemma <ref>

(Lemma <ref> is a natural generalization of <cit.>; see
also <cit.>, <cit.>, and <cit.>.)



One small change
is that a row vector X_ should be chosen so that
(X_∈ V) = _1≤ i ≤ n(X_i ∈
V).  Then we can apply a Fourier-analytic analog of the Littlewood-Offord
inequality using X_ (see Lemma <ref> in Appendix <ref>, and also
<cit.>) to show that the normal vector for V has at most
n/2 nonzero coordinates if n is sufficiently large.  Here, we need to
have chosen Q large enough so that the integral approximation in
Inequality (<ref>) (in the proof of Lemma <ref>)
is valid, which allows us to work entirely in .  Once we have shown
that the normal vector for V has at most n/2 nonzero coordinates, we can
follow the rest of the proof of <cit.>, applying
Lemma <ref> (with =0) in place of <cit.>.
(Lemma <ref> is a natural generalization of <cit.>; see
also <cit.>, <cit.>, and <cit.>.)




Let 0< ϵ_0 be a constant much smaller than 1, and let ∈ D be such that
(p + ϵ_0)^n/r <
 p^n- < /n.
Then

    ∑_V∈()(A_V) ≤1^n.


Here we choose the constant  so that >
(1/100+ ), where  is some absolute
constant such that 0< <1 (the 1/100 here comes from 
as defined in Section <ref> below; in <cit.>, it happens that the
constant  is also taken to be 1/100).

To prove Theorem <ref>, we can simply combine
Lemma <ref> with δ = (p + ϵ_0)^1/r, Lemma <ref>, and  Proposition <ref>.  Thus, proving Proposition <ref> will complete the
proof of Theorem <ref>.  To prove Proposition <ref>, as in <cit.>, we will separate hyperplanes V
of medium combinatorial dimension into two classes, which we will call
exceptional and unexceptional (see Definition <ref>).  See <cit.> for
motivation. The unexceptional case will be proved in the remainder of this
section, and the exceptional case will be proved in
Sections <ref>, <ref>, and <ref>.

The results in <cit.> and <cit.> were derived using the ideas that we
will use for the unexceptional medium combinatorial dimension case.  The idea
of considering the exceptional case separately in <cit.> (and using tools
from additive combinatorics in the exceptional case) is what lead to
the improvement of Inequality (<ref>), which gives a bound of asymptotically 34^n, over the .999^n bound in
<cit.>.




 §.§ Proof of the medium combinatorial dimension


 
Before defining exceptional and unexceptional hyperplanes, we will need some new notation. 

By assumption, the collection of random variables {α_ij}_1≤ i,j≤ n is  of exponent
r with a constant μ=1-p, with random variables
μ_ij corresponding to each α_ij, and with a constant 0< q ≤ p (see Definition <ref>).
We also define a constant slightly smaller than μ, namely := μ-ϵ_0100. 

We will let Y_i := (y_i,1, …, y_i,n) :=
(_i,1,…,_i,n) denote another row
vector that corresponds to the row vector X_i (_i,j
comes from the definition of ).  Also, we will let

    _i,k:= 
    (0,…,0^,
    y_i,k_start, …, y_i,k_end, 
    0,…, 0^),

where k_start:= (k-1)nr+1 and 
k_end:= knr.  The vector
_i,k can be thought of as the k-th segment of Y_i (out of r
roughly equal segments).  Note that Y_i and _i,k are both defined
using :=μ-ϵ_0100, not μ.  Finally, let
ϵ_1 be a positive constant that is small with respect to
ϵ_0, , and r.


Consider a hyperplane V of medium combinatorial dimension (that is, 
satisfies the condition in Proposition <ref>).

We say V is unexceptional if there exists an i_0 where 1 ≤
i_0 ≤ n and there exists a k_0 where 1 ≤ k_0 ≤ r such that

    max_1≤ j≤ n{(X_j∈ V)} < ϵ_1
    (_i_0,k_0∈ V).


We say V is exceptional if for every i where
1≤ i ≤ n and for every k where 1 ≤ k ≤ r we have

    ϵ_1 (_i,k∈ V) ≤max_1≤ j≤
    n{(X_j∈ V)}.

In particular, there exists i_max such that
(X_i_max∈ V)=_1≤ j ≤ n{(X_j ∈
V)}; and so if V is exceptional, then 

    ϵ_1 (_i_max,k∈ V) ≤(X_i_max∈ V)      k.

We  will  refer  to X_i_max as the exceptional row .

Inequality (<ref>) following Definition <ref>
can be used to give another relationship between
(_i_max,k∈ V) and
(X_i_max∈ V) that, together with
Inequality (<ref>), will be of critical importance in
Section <ref>.

Proposition <ref> follows from the two lemmas below, so
long as ϵ_1 is chosen suitably small with respect to ϵ_0,
, and r.


We have

    ∑_V∈(): V is unexceptional(A_V)≤
    p^-n 2^n ϵ_1^ϵ_0 n/r.




 

We have

    ∑_V∈(): V is exceptional(A_V)≤
    n^- n2 +  n.



We will prove Lemma <ref> in
Section <ref>, and we will prove Lemma <ref> in Section <ref>.



 §.§ The unexceptional medium combinatorial dimension case



The general idea for the case of an unexceptional hyperplane V is to replace
some of the rows X_i in the matrix  with rows that concentrate
more sharply on the subspace V.  In the case where the exponent r=1,
replacing a row X_i with
Y_i:=(_i,1,…,_i,n) is
successful; however, in the exponent r= 2 case, for example, replacing the
entire row results in a bound that is off by an exponential factor.
We solve this problem by replacing X_i with only
half of Y_i (with the other half of the entries being zero).
This idea easily extends to any integer r ≥ 2 and is the
motivation for defining the vectors _i,k to have all zeros except
for roughly n/r coordinates, as is done in Equation (<ref>).  The
basic utility of _i_0,k_0 (from Definition <ref>) is that
it concentrates more sharply on the unexceptional subspace V than the vector
X_i for any i.  

 
Let _i_0,k_0 be the vector from the definition of unexceptional
(Definition <ref>) such that (X_i ∈ V) < ϵ_1
(_i_0,k_0∈ V) for every i, and set
:=_i_0,j_0.  Let m be the closest integer to
ϵ_0 nr, where  is a small positive
absolute constant (for example, in <cit.>,  is taken to be
1/100).  Finally, let _1, …, _m be copies of
, independent of each other and of X_1, …, X_n.  



Let B_V,m be the event that _1, …, _m are linearly
independent and lie in V.  Then,

The argument follows the same reasoning as <cit.>, however,
the quantity 2^-n in <cit.> should be replaced by _1≤
i≤ n(X_i ∈ V).

Details are provided in Appendix <ref>.


To conclude the proof of Lemma <ref>, we follow the 
“row-swapping” argument at the end of <cit.>, with the small
change of bounding (X_i ∈ V) by _1≤
i≤ n(X_i ∈ V), which we use in place of the quantity
2^-n.
Details are provided in Appendix <ref>.




§ ANALYZING THE  EXCEPTIONAL MEDIUM COMBINATORIAL DIMENSION
CASE


The approach for exceptional V in <cit.> is very different from that
used in the unexceptional case or in the large or small combinatorial
dimension cases. Using some powerful tools from additive combinatorics, the
general idea is to put exceptional hyperplanes V in correspondence with a
particular additive structure called a , and then to show that
the number of the particular s that arise in this way is exceedingly
small.  The key to this approach is a structure theorem—namely,
<cit.>. In this section, we state a slightly modified
structure theorem (Theorem <ref>), and then we show
how to use Theorem <ref> to prove Lemma <ref>.  In the beginning of Section <ref>, we outline the changes needed to
prove the the structure theorem for our current context, and in
Sections <ref> and <ref> we provide details. 

Before stating the structure theorem, we need some definitions and notation.
A  of rank  is a set of the form

    P = {v_0 + m_1 v_1 + ⋯ + m_: m_i≤ M_i/2},

where the basis vectors v_0,v_1,…,v_ are elements of a
-module (here, ) and where the dimensions M_1,…,
M_ are positive integers.  We say that v_i has corresponding
dimension M_i.  For a given element a = v_0 + m_1 v_1 + ⋯ + m_
in P, we refer to m_1,…, m_ as coefficients for a.  A
 P is symmetric if v_0=0, and P is proper if for each
a∈ P, the there is a unique -tuple (m_1,…, m_) with
m_i< M_i/2 that gives the coefficients for a.  

If P is proper and symmetric, we define the P-norm a of an element a∈ P to be

    a := ( ∑_i=1^m_iM_i^2 )^1/2.


We will use the notation m P, where m is a positive integer, to denote the
set {∑_i=1^m x_i : x_i∈ P} and the notation P^m, where m is a
positive integer, to denote the set {∏_i=1^m x_i : x_i ∈ P}.  If
P is a  of rank , then so is mP, while P^m, on the other
hand, is a  of rank at most ^m.  Also note that mP≤ m^ P and that P^m≤P^m. 

Let V be an exceptional hyperplane of  medium combinatorial dimension in () and let  = (α_1,…,α_n) be the exceptional row
(here we are using α_j as shorthand for α_,j).  Let
(_1,…,_n) be the row of  random variables
corresponding to  from the definition of  of exponent r,
and let b_j,s with 1≤ j≤ n and 1≤ s≤ℓ_j be the values
taken by _j (see Equation (<ref>) for the definition
of _j).

Given an exceptional hyperplane V, there exists a representation of the form 

    V ={(x_1, x_2, …, x_n) ∈ ()^n  :  
     x_1 a_1 + x_2a_2 +
    ⋯ + x_na_n =0 }

for some elements a_1, a _2, …, a_n ∈.  We will call a_1,
a_2, …, a_n the  defining coordinates of V.  

Finally, let ã_j:=  a_j.  We will
refer to (ã_1,…,ã_n) as the scaled defining
coordinates of V .  Note that once  is fixed, so are the elements
.  We should also note that the choice of 
among b_j,s for 1≤ s ≤ℓ_j is arbitrary—since _j
takes the values b_j,s each with probability at least q, any value of
s will do; and so we have taken s=1 for convenience.

Let H denote the highly rational numbers , that is, those numbers in
 of the form a/b  Q where a,b are integers such that a,  b
≤ n^o(n) and b  0.  The highly rational
numbers were defined in <cit.>, and we will need a small
extension for the current paper, due to the fact that we are using the scaled
defining coordinates of V instead of simply the defining coordinates of V.
If we were to assume that  was an O(1) integer for all j and that
every possible value taken by α_ij was an O(1) integer for all
i,j, then we could still use the same definition of highly rational as in
<cit.>. However, if there is a  or an entry α_ij in the
matrix  that ever takes an irrational value, then when we pass
to  using Lemma <ref> we have to account for values
possibly on the order of Q (see Remark <ref>), and the highly
rational numbers are not sufficient for this task.  We can overcome this
difficulty by extending to the highly T-rational numbers, which
contain the highly rational numbers along with all the values in a structured
set T (described below). 




We will now give a rigorous definition the highly T-rational
numbers.

Let T be a  in  with rank O(1) and having cardinality at most
n^o(n).  As in the definition of  of exponent r
(Definition <ref>), we will take  to be
the  containing all possible values in  taken by the random
variables α_ij that are the entries of ; thus, by
assumption ≤ n^o(n).  By the definition of , we know
that all of the random variables _ij take values in a set with
cardinality O(1).  Thus, there is a symmetric  T with rank O(1) and
cardinality T≤ n^o(n) such that T contains S, such that T
contains the set {-1,0,1}, and such that T contains all the values taken
by the _ij.  To construct T from S, one can, for example,
add each distinct value taken by a _ij as a new basis vector
v' with corresponding dimension M':= 3 (say).

A highly T-rational number h is any element of  of the form
a/b, where a,b ∈ n^o(n) T^O(1).  Note that therefore, the
cardinality of the  numbers is at most (n^d o(n)T)^O(1) =
n^o(n), where d=O(1) is the rank of T (here we used the fact that
T≤ n^o(n)).


There is a constant C=C(,ϵ_0,ϵ_1,ϵ_2,q,r,μ) such
that the following holds.  Let V be an exceptional hyperplane and let
ã_1, …, ã_n be its  scaled defining coordinates (as
described above).  Then there exist integers

	1≤≤C

and M_1,…, M_≥ 1 with the volume bound

M_1 ⋯M_≤C(∈V)^-1

and nonzero elements v_1,…, v_∈ such that the following
holds


  * 
(i)  (Scaled defining coordinates lie in a progression) The
symmetric 
	P:= {m_1v_1+⋯+m_v_: -M_i/2 < m_i < M_i/2 }

is proper and contains all of the ã_j.


  * 
(ii)
(Bounded norm) The ã_j have small P-norm:

	∑_j=1^n ã_j^2 ≤C.


  * 
(iii)
(Rational T-commensurability)
The set {v_1,…,v_}∪{ã_1,…, ã_n} is
contained in the set 

	{ h v_1: }.

Let p be a positive constant such that 0< p<1, let r be a positive
integer constant, and let S be a  in the complex numbers with rank
O(1) (independent of n) and with cardinality at most S ≤
n^o(n).

Let  be an n by n matrix with entries α_jk, each
of which is an independent random variable taking values in S. If the collection of random variables
{α_jk}_1≤ j,k≤ n  is  of exponent r, then

    ()
     (p^1/r +1) ^n.





In the motivating
examples of Section <ref> (excluding Corollary <ref>), we
discussed the case where the entries of the matrix are i.i.d.; however, in
general the distributions of the entries are allowed to differ (and even
depend on n), so long as the entries all take values in the same structured
set S described above.

The condition that S has additive structure seems to be an artifact of the
proof (in particular, at certain points in the proof of Theorem <ref>, we need the set {∑_j=1^n x_j : x_j ∈ S 
j} to have cardinality at most n^o(n)).  The easiest way to guarantee
that S has the required structure is to assume that the set of values taken
by all the α_jk has cardinality at most O(1), and this is the
approach we take for the corollaries in Section <ref>, since it
also makes it easy to demonstrate that the collection of entries is .



Note that the constants μ,, must be such that the right-hand side of Equation (<ref>) is non-negative.  It turns out for
the proof of Theorem <ref> that we will need slightly more.

At one point in the proof, we will apply Lemma <ref>, for which we
we must assume that there exists a very small constant >0 such that E(e(_jk t))>  for all t and for all _jk
used in the definition of  of exponent r.  Of course, if the
expectations are not strictly larger than , we can simply reduce μ
by ϵ_-1>0.  Then, since we are assuming 1-μ=p, we clearly have
that all the α_jk are (p+ϵ_-1)-bounded of exponent r
(by using μ-_jk instead of _jk) and we
have that E(e(μ-_jk t))> >0.  Since
Theorem <ref> would thus yield a bound of
((p+ϵ_-1)^1/r + o(1))^n for every ϵ_-1>0, we can
conclude a bound of (p^1/r + o(1))^n by letting  tend to 0.
Thus, without loss of generality, we will assume that E(e(_jk t))> for all t and for all _jk
used in the definition of  of exponent r.  






§ SOME COROLLARIES OF THEOREM <REF>
 


In this section, we will state a number of corollaries of Theorem <ref>, starting with short proofs of Inequalities (<ref>),
(<ref>), and (<ref>).  The two most interesting results in
this section will be more general: first (in Section <ref>), we will
show an exponential bound on the singularity probability for a matrix with
independent entries
each a symmetric random variable taking values in ⊂
C, where ≤ O(1) and assuming that each entry takes the value 0 with probability 1-μ; and
second (in Section <ref>), we will describe a similar (and
sometimes better) bound when the condition that the random variables have
symmetric distributions is replaced
with the assumption that no entry takes a value with probability greater than
p.  In the first case, the bound will depend only the value of μ, and in
the second case, the bound will depend only on the value of p.
In Section <ref>, we will show an exponential bound on the singularity
probability for an n by n  matrix with = o(n) fixed rows containing
small integer values and with the remaining rows containing independent random
variables taking values in S⊂ C, where S≤ O(1) (this is
similar to Corollary <ref>, which is proved in
Section <ref>).  Finally, in Section <ref>, we will prove an
exponential upper bound on the probability that a random integer matrix has a
rational eigenvalue.

In each corollary, we will use the definition of  of exponent 1
and of exponent 2.  The definition of  of exponent 2 is
particularly useful, since then the absolute value on the left-hand side of
Inequality (<ref>) is automatically dealt with; however, when μ
is small (for example whenever μ≤ 1/2), one can get better bounds by
using  of exponent 1.  We have not yet found an example where the
best possible bound from Theorem <ref> is found by using
 of an exponent higher than 2.



 §.§ Proving Inequalities (<ref>), (<ref>), and
(<ref>)


To prove Inequality (<ref>), we note for 
0 ≤μ≤1/2 that (using the definition in
Equation (<ref>) of ) 

    𝔼(e( t)) = 1 - μ + μcos(2π t),


and thus  is (1-μ)-bounded of exponent 1
(i.e., take :=), and so Inequality (<ref>)
follows from Theorem <ref>.


To prove Inequality (<ref>), we note for 1/2≤μ≤ 1 that 

    𝔼(e( t)) = 1 - μ + μcos( 2π t)≤2μ+14 +(1-μ)cos(2π t) + 2μ-14cos(4π t)


(the inequality above may be checked by squaring both sides and expanding as
polynomials in cos(2π t)).  Thus, we can take 

	:= 
	+2     2μ-1/8 

	-2     2μ-1/8 

	+1     1-μ/2 

	-1     1-μ/2 

	0     2μ+1/4
	

to see that  is (2μ+1/4)-bounded of exponent 1, and so Inequality (<ref>) follows
from Theorem <ref>.

To prove Inequality (<ref>), we note for 0 ≤μ≤ 1 that 

    𝔼(e( t))^2 = 1 - μ + μcos( 2π t)^2 
    = 1-2μ+3/2μ^2 +2(1-μ)μcos(2π t) + μ^22cos(4π
    t).


Thus, we can take 

	:= 
	+2     μ^2/4 

	-2     μ^2/4 

	+1     (1-μ)μ

	-1     (1-μ)μ

	0      1-2μ+3/2 μ^2
	

to see that  is (1-2μ+3/2μ^2
)-bounded of exponent 2, and so Inequality (<ref>) follows
from Theorem <ref>.




 §.§ Matrices with entries having symmetric distributions


In this subsection, we will prove a singularity bound for an n by n matrix
 for which each entry is a symmetric discrete random variable
taking the value 0 with probability 1-μ.


Let  be a set of complex numbers with cardinality ≤ O(1).
If  is an n by n matrix in which each entry is an independent
symmetric complex random variable taking values in S and taking the
value 0 with probability 1-μ, then

	() ≤
		(1-μ+ o(1))^n     0≤μ≤1/2 

		(2μ+1/4 + o(1))^n    1/2≤μ≤1
		

		(√(1-2μ+3/2μ^2) +o(1))^n    0≤μ≤1.
	

In particular, the same upper bounds as in Inequalities (<ref>),
(<ref>), and (<ref>) (which are shown in Figure <ref>) apply to the singularity probability for .



Let α_ij be an entry of .  Since α_ij is symmetric
and takes the value 0 with probability 1-μ, we may write α_ij =
_ijη_ij, where _ij is an independent
copy of  as defined in Equation (<ref>) and η_ij is a random variable that shares no values
with -η_ij.  This description of α_ij was inspired by
<cit.>, and it allows us to condition on η_ij and then use the
remaining randomness in _ij to get a bound on the singularity
probability.  In particular,

	()    = ∑_(c_ij) 
	( | {η_ij =c_ij}) ({η_ij
	=c_ij}),

where the sum runs over all (n^2)-tuples (c_ij)_1≤ i,j≤ n of
possible values taken by random variables η_ij.  Since
∑_(c_ij)({η_ij =c_ij}) =1, we can
complete the proof by proving an exponential bound on ( | {η_ij =c_ij}), and we will use Theorem <ref> for this task.  

Consider the random matrix , where the i,j entry is the random
variable c_ij_ij for some constant c_ij.  Note that the
entries of  take values in S, a set with cardinality O(1), and let
 be the map from Lemma <ref>, which lets us pass to
the case where  has entries in .  Defining θ_ij:=
2π(c_ij), we compute

	    E e((c_ij_ij) t) 
	= 1-μ+ μcos(θ_ijt) 
	

	       ≤
1-μ+ μcos(θ_ijt)
	    0≤μ≤1/2, 


2μ+1/4 +(1-μ)cos(θ_ijt) +
2μ-14cos(2θ_ij t)
	    1/2≤μ≤1,  


(0pt11pt 
1-2μ+3/2 μ^2 +2(1-μ)μcos(θ_ij t) +
μ^2/2cos(2θ_ij t) )^1/2
	    0≤μ≤1.


We have thus shown that the entries of  are

	   (1-μ)
	0≤μ≤1/2,

	
	   (2μ+1/4) 
		1/2 ≤μ≤1, 
	
	   (1-2μ+3/2μ^2) 
		0≤μ≤1.	

Applying Theorem <ref> completes the proof.  

Corollary <ref> is tight for 0≤μ≤1/2, since the
probability of a row of all zeroes occurring is (1-μ +o(1))^n; however,
for any specific case, Theorem <ref> can usually prove better
upper bounds than those given by Corollary <ref>. 


For example, consider the case of a matrix  with each entry an
independent copy of the symmetric random variable

	:= 

	+2     μ/4 

	-2     μ/4 

	+1     μ/4 

	-1     μ/4 

	0      1-μ


 
For  as defined above, we have

	() ≤
	(1-μ+ o(1) )^n     0 ≤μ≤16/25

	(√(1-2μ+5/4 μ^2) + o(1) )^n     0≤μ≤1.
	




By the definition of  we have

	E e(t) = 1-μ+μ/2 cos(2πt) +μ/2
	cos(4πt),     0≤μ≤16/25

(i.e., the right-hand side of the equation above is non-negative for such
μ), which proves the first bound.  

Also, we have

	E e(t)^2    = 1-2μ+5/4μ^2 +
	(μ-3/4μ^2) cos(2πt) + (μ-7/8μ^2)
	cos(4πt) 

   3in0pt+ μ^2/4 cos(6πt) + μ^2/8 cos(8πt)

for 0≤μ≤1, which proves the second bound.

dependency



The results of Corollary <ref> and the corresponding lower bounds are
shown in Figure <ref>, and one should note that the upper bounds are
substantially better than those guaranteed by Corollary <ref>.




 §.§ Random  matrices with entries having arbitrary distributions



A useful feature of the definition of  of exponent 2 is that it
lets one bound the singularity probability of matrices with independent discrete
random variables that are asymmetric. 


Let p be a constant such that 0<p≤ 1 and let ⊂ C be a set
with cardinality ≤ O(1).
If  is an n by n matrix with independent random entries taking
values in S such that for any entry α, we have max_x (α =
x)≤ p, then

    ()≤ (√(p) + o(1))^n.



We will need the following slightly more general corollary in
Section <ref>. For a set A and an integer m, we will use the
notation mA :={∑_j=1^m a_j : a_j ∈ A} and A^m:= {∏_j=1^m
a_j : a_j ∈ A}. 


Let p be a constant such that 0<p≤ 1, let ⊂ C be a set
with cardinality ≤ O(1), and let X_n be an n by n matrix
with fixed, non-random entries in n^o(n)(S ∪{-1,0,1})^O(1).
If  is an n by n matrix with independent random entries taking
values in S such that for any entry α, we have max_x (α =
x)≤ p, then

    (X_n + )≤ (√(p) + o(1))^n.


Note that that Corollary <ref> implies Corollary <ref> by
taking X_n to be the matrix of all zeroes. 


Let α_ij be an entry in .  Our goal is to describe
α_ij in a two-step random process, condition on one of the steps, and
then use the randomness in the other step to bound the singularity
probability.  The conditioning approach is the same as that used in the
symmetric case (Corollary <ref>) and was inspired by
<cit.>.  The conditioning argument is useful since some entries of
the random matrix may take some values with very small probability (i.e.
probability less than any constant);  recall that while the entries of the
random matrix always take values in a fixed set S of cardinality O(1), the
distributions of those random variables within S are allowed to
vary with n.  (Note that making use of Remark <ref> would provide an
alternate way of dealing with entries that take some values with very small
probability.)


Say that α_ij takes the values v_1,…,v_t
with probabilities ϱ_1,…, ϱ_t, respectively, where
ϱ_1≥ϱ_2 ≥⋯≥ϱ_t.  Define new random variables
η_ijk such that for some i_0
and i_1, the values taken by η_ijk are v_i_0,
v_i_0+1,…,v_i_0 + i_1 with corresponding probabilities
ϱ_i_0/p_k,
ϱ_i_0+1/p_k,…,ϱ_i_0 + i_1/p_k, where p_k:=
∑_i=1^i_1ϱ_i_0 + i.  Thus, we can write
 
	α_ij = 
	η_ij1      p_1 

	η_ij2      p_2 

	⋮    ⋮

	η_ijℓ      p_ℓ.
	

Furthermore, the η_ijk can be constructed so that p_k ≤ p for
every k, so that p/2 ≤ p_k for 1≤ k ≤ℓ -1, and so that no two
η_ijk with different k's ever take the same value.  


There are two cases to consider for the technical reason that p_ℓ is not
necessarily bounded below by a constant.  Let ϵ>0 be
a very small constant, so for example p/2> ϵ.  Case 1 is when ϵ≤ p_ℓ, and in this case each
p_k is bounded below by ϵ and above  by p.
We will consider Case 1 first and then discuss the
small changes needed to deal with Case 2.

As in the proof of Corollary <ref>, we will
condition on the values taken by the η_ijk in order to prove a
bound on the singularity probability.  We have that 

    (X_n + ) = ∑_(c_ijk)(X_n +  | {η_ijk=c_ijk}) ({η_ijk=c_ijk}),

where the sum runs over all possible values (c_ijk) that the η_ijk
can take.  Thus, it is sufficient to prove a bound on the singularity
probability for the random matrix X_n + which has random entries

	+α_ij = 
	+c_ij1      p_1 

	+c_ij2      p_2 

	⋮    ⋮

	+c_ijℓ      p_ℓ,
	

where  and the c_ijk are constants.

Note the entries of X_n+ take values in , a  with rank
O(1) and cardinality at most n^o(n), and let  be the
map from Lemma <ref>, which lets us pass to the case where
X_n+ has entries in .  Defining θ_ijk:=
2π(c_ijk) and letting α'_ij be an i.i.d. copy of α_ij, we compute

	E e((+α_ij) t)^2 
	   =E e
	(0pt11pt
	(+α_ij--α_ij') t) 
	=E e
	(0pt11pt
	(α_ij-α_ij') t) 

	

	   = ∑_k=1^ℓp_k^2 + 2 ∑_1≤k_1<k_2≤ℓ p_k_1 p_k_2
	cos((θ_ijk_1-θ_ijk_2)t).

Thus, +α_ij is (∑_k=1^ℓ p_k^2)-bounded of
exponent 2 (using the constant q = ϵ^2 in Definition <ref>, so q does not depend on n). Given that 0<p_k≤ p for every
k, it is not hard to show that ∑_k=1^ℓ p_k^2  ≤ p< p+ϵ,
and so from Definition <ref>, we see that the collection
{+α_ij: α_ij p_ℓ≥ϵ} is (p + ϵ)-bounded of
exponent 2.  We are thus finished with Case 1.

Case 2 is when the decomposition of α_ij given in Equation (<ref>) has
p_ℓ < ϵ.  In this case we need to modify Equation (<ref>)
slightly, deleting η_ijℓ and replacing η_ij(ℓ-1) with a new
variable η_ij(ℓ-1)' that takes all the values previously taken by
η_ijℓ and by η_ij(ℓ-1) with the appropriate probabilities.  
Thus, in Case 2, we have that p/2≤ p_k < p+ϵ for all 1≤ k≤ℓ -1, showing that each p_k is bounded below by a constant and is
bounded above by p+ϵ (here we are using p_ℓ -1 to denote
the probability that α_ij draws a value from the random variable
η_ij(ℓ-1)').

For Case 2, we use exactly the same reasoning as in Case 1 above to show that 
such entries of X_n+ are (∑_k=1^ℓ-1 p_k^2)-bounded of
exponent 2 (using the constant q=ϵ^2<p^2/4 in
Definition <ref>, so q does not depend on n). Noting
that ∑_k=1^ℓ-1 p_k^2<p+ϵ and using
Definition <ref>, we see that the collection
{+α_ij: α_ij p_ℓ < ϵ} is (p + ϵ)-bounded of
exponent 2.

Combining Case 1 and Case 2, we have that the collection
{+α_ij} is (p + ϵ)-bounded of exponent
2, and so by and by Theorem <ref> we have that (X_n+) 

≤(√(p +ϵ) + o(1))^n.

The constant ϵ>0 was chosen arbitrarily, and so letting
ϵ tend to zero, we get that 

    (X_n+ |
    {η_ijk=c_ijk}) ≤( √(p) + o(1))^n.







 §.§ Partially random matrices 



In this subsection, we prove a bound on the singularity probability for partly
random matrices where many rows are deterministic.

  
Let p be a real constant between 0 and 1, let K be a large positive
constant, and let S⊂ C be a set of complex numbers having
cardinality S ≤ K.  Let  be an n by n matrix in which
 rows contain fixed, non-random integers between -K and K and where
the other rows contain entries that are independent random variables taking
values in S.  If ≤ o(n), if the  fixed rows are linearly
independent, and if for every random entry α, we have max_x (α
= x) ≤ p, then

    ()≤(√(p) + o(1))^n-.



Corollary <ref> applies
to partly random matrices with = o(n) fixed, non-random rows containing
integers bounded by a constant and with random entries taking at most O(1)
values in the complex numbers.   Corollary <ref>, on the other
hand, holds with the fixed entries also allowed to take values in the complex
numbers and gives a sligtly better bound, but additionally requires ≤
O(ln n) (which is far smaller in general than o(n)).  Proving
Corollary <ref> requires mirroring the entire argument used to
prove the main theorem (Theorem <ref>) in the case where 
rows contain fixed, non-random entires, and we discuss this argument in
Section <ref>.  Proving Corollary <ref>, however, can be
done directly from Theorem <ref>, as we will show below.  First,
we will state a generalization of Corollary <ref>.

  
Let p be a real constant between 0 and 1, let K be a large positive
constant, and let S⊂ C be a set of complex numbers having
cardinality S ≤ K.   Let  be an n by n matrix in which
 rows contain fixed, non-random integers between -K and K and where
the other rows contain entries that are independent random variables taking
values in S. If ≤ o(n), if the fixed rows have co-rank k, 
and if for every random entry α, we have max_x (α =
x) ≤ p, then

    ( >k)≤(√(p) + o(1))^n-.




To obtain Corollary <ref> from Corollary <ref>, find
a collection C of -k linearly independent rows among the
deterministic rows. Replace the rest of the deterministic rows with a
collection C' of rows containing integer values between -K and K
such that C' is linearly independent from C. Finally, apply
Corollary <ref> to the new partially random matrix whose
deterministic rows are from C ∪ C', thus proving
Corollary <ref>. 



By reordering the rows and columns, we may write

    = ([ A B; C D ]),

where A is an  by  non-random invertible matrix, B is an
 by n- non-random matrix, C is an n- by  random
matrix, and D is an n- by n- random matrix.  Note that 
is singular if and only if there exists a vector 𝐯 such that 𝐯 =0.  Let 𝐯_1 be the first  coordinates of 𝐯 and let 𝐯_2 be the remaining n- coordinates.  Then 𝐯 = 0 if and only if

    A 𝐯_1 + B 𝐯_2 = 0, 
    
    C 𝐯_1 + D 𝐯_2 = 0.

Since A is invertible, these two equations are satisfied if and only if
(-CA^-1B + D) 𝐯_2 = 0, that is, if and only if the random matrix
-CA^-1B + D is singular.  

We want to show that every entry that can appear in -CA^-1B is an element
of .  By the cofactor formula for A^-1, we know that the i,j
entry of A^-1 is (-1)^i+j( A_ij)/ A, where A_ij is the
-1 by -1 matrix formed by deleting the i-th row and j-th
column of A.  Thus, A^-1 = 1/ AA, where the i,j
entry of A is (-1)^i+j A_ij.  By the volume formula for
the determinant, we know that A is at most the product of the
lengths of the row vectors of A; and thus A≤ n^o(n) (here
we need that A has integer entries between -K and K, where K is a
constant, and that ≤ o(n)).  Similarly, we have A_ij≤
n^o(n).  Every entry of A is thus in n^o(n){-1,0,1}, every
entry of C is in S, and every entry of B is in O(1){-1,0,1}; thus,
every entry of -CA B is an element of n^o(n)(S∪{-1,0,1}). 


Conditioning on the values taken by all the entries in C, we have

	()    = (-CA^-1B + D)
	

	    = ∑_(c_ij) (-CA^-1B + D | C= (c_ij))
	(C = (c_ij)), 

where the sum runs over all possible matrices (c_ij) that
C can produce.   Considering the entries in C=(c_ij) to be fixed (note
that A and B are fixed by assumption), we now need to bound 

    (-(c_ij)A^-1B + D )
    =(-(c_ij)AB + ( A) D ).

Note that every entry of -(c_ij)AB is an element of 
and that the random matrix ( A) D has entries that take values in the
fixed set {( A) s: s∈ S} having cardinality O(1).  Thus, by
Corollary <ref>, we have that 

    (-(c_ij)AB + ( A) D ) ≤ (√(p) +
    o(1))^n-.

Plugging this bound back into Equation (<ref>) completes the proof.




 §.§ Integer matrices and rational eigenvalues


Let η_k be the random variable taking the values -k, -k+1, …, k-1,
k each with equal probability, and let M_n be the n by n matrix where
each entry is an independent copy of η_k.  In <cit.>, Martin and
Wong show that for any ϵ >0, 
    (M_n ) ≤c(n,ϵ)/ k^1-ϵ,
 


where c(n,ϵ) is a constant depending on n and ϵ.  (One
goal in <cit.> is to study this bound as k goes to ∞ while
n is fixed, which is why c(n,ϵ) is allowed to depend on n.)  


Below, we prove a similar result for random integer matrices with
entries between -k and k (with k fixed), where we allow each entry to
have a different (independent) distribution and we also allow the
distributions to be very general.


Fix a positive integer k, and let  be a random integer matrix with
independent entries, each of which takes values in the set
{-k,-k+1,…,k-1, k}.  
Let c be a constant such that for every entry α,  we have
max_-k≤ x≤ k(α =x) ≤ c/k.
Then 

    () ≤(c/k + o(1))^n/2,

where the o(1) term goes to zero as n goes to ∞.



For example, in the case where each independent entry has the uniform
distribution on {-k,-k+1,…,k-1, k} (as in <cit.>), one can
set c=1/2 in the corollary above.


The proof given below follows the same outline as the main theorem of
<cit.>, with Corollary <ref> replacing an appeal to
<cit.>.  

The characteristic polynomial for  is monic with integer coefficients,
and thus the only possible rational eigenvalues are integers (by the rational
roots theorem).  Every eigenvalue of  has absolute value at most nk
(see <cit.>); thus, the only possible integer eigenvalues are
between -nk and nk.  

The matrix  has λ as an eigenvalue if and only if -
λ I is singular (where I is the n by n identity matrix).  By
Corollary <ref> (with = 0), we have

    ( - λ I ) ≤( √(c/k) +
    o(1))^n.

Using the union bound, we have

	()    =
	
	(-λI  )

	   ≤∑_λ= -nk^nk  (- λI ) 

	   ≤(2nk +1) ( √(c/k) + o(1))^n

	   ≤( c/k + o(1))^n/2.







§ RANDOM MATRICES WITH COMPLEX ENTRIES:
A REDUCTION TECHNIQUE




The original work on discrete random matrices in <cit.> is
concerned with matrices having integer entries, which can also be viewed as
matrices with entries in  where Q is a very large prime.  In this
section we show that  one can  pass from a  (random) matrix with entries in
C to one with entries in  where Q is an arbitrarily large
prime number, all without affecting the probability that the determinant is
zero, thanks to the following lemma. 



Let  be a finite subset of C.  There exist infinitely many 
primes Q such that there is a ring homomorphism :[] → 
satisfying the following two properties:


  (i)  the map  is injective on , and

  (ii)  for any n by n matrix (s_ij)_1≤ i,j≤ n with entries s_ij∈ S,
we have 
    (0pt14pt(s_ij)_1≤ i,j≤ n) = 0     (0pt14pt((s_ij))_1≤ i,j≤ n)=0.





In order to apply this lemma, let us point out that the proof of
Theorem <ref>, which is discussed in Sections <ref> through
<ref>, works exclusively in ; though at various points, it is
necessary to assume Q is extremely large with respect to n and various
constants.  For this paper, S will be the set of  all  possible values taken
by the random variables α_jk.  Recall that by assumption,
≤ n^o(n), so in particular, S is finite.





When we apply Lemma <ref>, we will take Q>exp(exp(Cn))
for some constant C in order for Freiman-type theorems such as
<cit.> (which is restated in Theorem <ref> below) to
apply, and we will also choose Q large enough so that the integral
approximation in Inequality (<ref>)
holds and so that Q is large with respect to various constants.  One should
note that while Q can be taken arbitrarily large with respect to n, we
cannot choose Q so that it is arbitrarily large with respect to (s)
for all s∈, where  is the set of all
values that could appear in the given random matrix.  For example, if √(2)∈, then the smallest positive integer representative for (√(2)) must be larger than √(Q) (since ((√(2)))^2 = 2 in
).  Finally, if we were in a situation where ⊂ Q, then
we could avoid using Lemma <ref> altogether by clearing
denominators to pass to Z and then take Q≈exp(exp(Cn)), as is
done in <cit.>.  

Lemma <ref> is a corollary of the main theorem of
<cit.> and its proof is  given in detail in <cit.>.
The paper  <cit.> also contains  further applications of the method
used to prove Lemma <ref>, for example proving a sum-product
result for the complex numbers and proving a Szemerédi-Trotter-type result
for the complex numbers, where the applications follow from the analogous
results for Z/Q where Q is a prime (see <cit.>).  The results
in <cit.>, including Lemma <ref>, all go through with
the complex numbers being replaced by any characteristic zero integral domain.
Thus, the results stated in Sections <ref>, <ref>, and
<ref> above for the complex numbers C also all go through
with C replaced by any characteristic zero integral domain.  For
example, Corollary <ref> becomes

 Let p be a constant such that 0<p≤ 1 and let D be a
characteristic zero integral domain.  Let S⊂ D have cardinality S≤ O(1).  If  is an n by n matrix with
independent random entries, each taking values in S, such that for
every entry α, we have max_x (α = x)≤ p, then 
    ()≤ (√(p) + o(1))^n.
 




§ PROOF OF THE MAIN THEOREM (THEOREM <REF>)


The proof of Theorem <ref> very closely follows the proof of
<cit.>.  Our goal is to highlight
the changes that need to be made to generalize the proof in <cit.>
so that it proves Theorem <ref>.  A reader interested in the
details of the proof of Theorem <ref> should read this paper
alongside of <cit.>.  Throughout the proof, we will assume that n is
sufficiently large, and we will allow constants hidden in the o(·) and
O(·) notation to depend on the constants ϵ_-1, ϵ_0,
ϵ_1, ϵ_2, p,q,r, , ,
, and .  The constants ϵ_-1, ϵ_0,
ϵ_1, ϵ_2 should be considered very small, and, in fact, we will
let them tend to zero to prove the full strength of  Theorem <ref>.  The constants p,q,r, , ,
, and  can be thought of as absolute, except possibly
for depending on each other.



 §.§ Definitions and preliminaries


Given an n by n matrix  with entries α_ij, we
assume that the collection of independent random variables
{α_ij}_1≤ i,j≤ n is  for some fixed constants
p, q, and r (here, q is the constant from Definition <ref> which is independent of n).  We also assume that each α_ij takes at most
n^o(n) distinct values.  Using Lemma <ref>, we may
assume without loss of generality that each α_ij takes values in
 for some very large prime Q.  The entirety of the proof will take
place over the field , and so terminology such as “linearly
independent”, “span”, “dimension”, “rank” and so forth will always be
with respect to the field .

Let X_i:=(α_i,1,…,α_i,n) denote the i-th row of
.  We note that  has determinant zero if and
only if there is a linear dependency among the rows X_i.  It has been shown
(see 

<cit.> and also <cit.>) that the dominant contribution to
the singularity probability comes from the X_i spanning a hyperplane (of
dimension n-1).  In particular,

	() = p^-o(n) 
	∑_V a non-trivial_hyperplane in	()^n (A_V),

where A_V denotes the event that X_1,…, X_n span V, and
B_MATH_TERM means that V contains the origin, V is spanned by vectors in
S^n (where S is the set of all possible values that can occur in N_n), and (X_i ∈ V) > 0 for all i.

As in <cit.>, we will divide the non-trivial hyperplanes into n^2
classes, since it is then sufficient to show that the sum of (A_V) over
all V in a particular class is at most (p^1/r+ 1)^n. 


 
Let D := 

{a/n: 0 ≤ a ≤ n^2, a∈ Z}.
For any d_±∈ D such that ≥1/n, we define the
combinatorial Grassmannian () to be the set of all
non-trivial hyperplanes V in ()^n such that 

    p^n-+1/n < _1≤ i≤ n(X_i∈ V)
    ≤ p^n-.

For = 0, we define  (0) to be the set of all
non-trivial hyperplanes such that

    _1≤ i≤ n(X_i∈ V) ≤ p^n.

We will refer to  as the combinatorial
dimension of V.  


Note that () = ∅ for ≥ n-1+1/n (by
Lemma <ref>).  We will consider
hyperplanes V with combinatorial dimension in three main regions: 
small,  medium-sized, and  large.  The two lemmas and the
proposition below suffice to prove Theorem <ref>.



For any δ >0 we have

    ∑_∈ D  s.t. p^n-≤δ^n  ∑_V ∈()(A_V) ≤ n δ^n.



In proving Theorem <ref>, we will take δ = (p +
ϵ_0)^1/r to take care of all small  not
covered by Proposition <ref> below.  





The reasoning here is the same as in <cit.>, making use of fact
that (X_i ∈ V) ≤_1≤ i ≤ n(X_i ∈
V) ≤ p^n-≤δ^n.  In particular,

    (A_V) ≤∑_i=1^n ({X_j}_1≤ j≤ n∖{X_i} V)(X_i ∈ V),

which completes the proof since the summing the right-hand side over all V
is at most n max_i(X_i ∈ V) (note that an instance of the
vectors {X_j}_1≤ j≤ n∖{X_i} can span at most one
hyperplane).




We have

    ∑_∈ D  s.t. /√(n)≤ p^n-  ∑_V ∈()(A_V) ≤ (p+1)^n



Here we choose the constant  so that ≥
 p^-1/n√(2r/q),
where  is the constant from the Littlewood-Offord inequality
(see Lemma <ref> in Appendix <ref>) and q is the constant from
Definition <ref>.


Our proof is essentially the same as <cit.>.  Fix V ∈(), where /√(n)≤ p^n-.  Let  be an index such that (X_∈ V) = max_1≤ i≤ n(X_i ∈ V).  By assumption,

    (X_∈ V) ≥ p^n-+1/n≥/√(n) p^1/n≥√(2r/qn).

Noting that X_∈ V if and only if X_ is orthogonal to the normal vector for V, we have by Lemma <ref> that

    (X_∈ V) ≤√(r/qk),

where k is the number of nonzero coordinates in the normal vector to V.  Combining the two inequalities above shows that k≤ n/2.

Thus, we have

∑_∈D  s.t. /√(n)≤p^n-
  ∑_V ∈() (A_V)    ≤({} ) 


    ≤(p+1)^n               by Lemma <ref>

(Lemma <ref> is a natural generalization of <cit.>; see
also <cit.>, <cit.>, and <cit.>.)



One small change
is that a row vector X_ should be chosen so that
(X_∈ V) = _1≤ i ≤ n(X_i ∈
V).  Then we can apply a Fourier-analytic analog of the Littlewood-Offord
inequality using X_ (see Lemma <ref> in Appendix <ref>, and also
<cit.>) to show that the normal vector for V has at most
n/2 nonzero coordinates if n is sufficiently large.  Here, we need to
have chosen Q large enough so that the integral approximation in
Inequality (<ref>) (in the proof of Lemma <ref>)
is valid, which allows us to work entirely in .  Once we have shown
that the normal vector for V has at most n/2 nonzero coordinates, we can
follow the rest of the proof of <cit.>, applying
Lemma <ref> (with =0) in place of <cit.>.
(Lemma <ref> is a natural generalization of <cit.>; see
also <cit.>, <cit.>, and <cit.>.)




Let 0< ϵ_0 be a constant much smaller than 1, and let ∈ D be such that
(p + ϵ_0)^n/r <
 p^n- < /n.
Then

    ∑_V∈()(A_V) ≤1^n.


Here we choose the constant  so that >
(1/100+ ), where  is some absolute
constant such that 0< <1 (the 1/100 here comes from 
as defined in Section <ref> below; in <cit.>, it happens that the
constant  is also taken to be 1/100).

To prove Theorem <ref>, we can simply combine
Lemma <ref> with δ = (p + ϵ_0)^1/r, Lemma <ref>, and  Proposition <ref>.  Thus, proving Proposition <ref> will complete the
proof of Theorem <ref>.  To prove Proposition <ref>, as in <cit.>, we will separate hyperplanes V
of medium combinatorial dimension into two classes, which we will call
B_MATH_TERM and B_MATH_TERM (see Definition <ref>).  See <cit.> for
motivation. The unexceptional case will be proved in the remainder of this
section, and the exceptional case will be proved in
Sections <ref>, <ref>, and <ref>.

The results in <cit.> and <cit.> were derived using the ideas that we
will use for the unexceptional medium combinatorial dimension case.  The idea
of considering the exceptional case separately in <cit.> (and using tools
from additive combinatorics in the exceptional case) is what lead to
the improvement of Inequality (<ref>), which gives a bound of asymptotically 34^n, over the .999^n bound in
<cit.>.




 §.§ Proof of the medium combinatorial dimension


 
Before defining exceptional and unexceptional hyperplanes, we will need some new notation. 

By assumption, the collection of random variables {α_ij}_1≤ i,j≤ n is  of exponent
r with a constant μ=1-p, with random variables
μ_ij corresponding to each α_ij, and with a constant 0< q ≤ p (see Definition <ref>).
We also define a constant slightly smaller than μ, namely := μ-ϵ_0100. 

We will let Y_i := (y_i,1, …, y_i,n) :=
(_i,1,…,_i,n) denote another row
vector that corresponds to the row vector X_i (_i,j
comes from the definition of ).  Also, we will let

    _i,k:= 
    (0,…,0^,
    y_i,k_start, …, y_i,k_end, 
    0,…, 0^),

where k_start:= (k-1)nr+1 and 
k_end:= knr.  The vector
_i,k can be thought of as the k-th segment of Y_i (out of r
roughly equal segments).  Note that Y_i and _i,k are both defined
using :=μ-ϵ_0100, not μ.  Finally, let
ϵ_1 be a positive constant that is small with respect to
ϵ_0, , and r.


Consider a hyperplane V of medium combinatorial dimension (that is, 
satisfies the condition in Proposition <ref>).

We say V is unexceptional if there exists an i_0 where 1 ≤
i_0 ≤ n and there exists a k_0 where 1 ≤ k_0 ≤ r such that

    max_1≤ j≤ n{(X_j∈ V)} < ϵ_1
    (_i_0,k_0∈ V).


We say V is exceptional if for every i where
1≤ i ≤ n and for every k where 1 ≤ k ≤ r we have

    ϵ_1 (_i,k∈ V) ≤max_1≤ j≤
    n{(X_j∈ V)}.

In particular, there exists i_max such that
(X_i_max∈ V)=_1≤ j ≤ n{(X_j ∈
V)}; and so if V is exceptional, then 

    ϵ_1 (_i_max,k∈ V) ≤(X_i_max∈ V)      k.

We  will  refer  to X_i_max as the B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM .

Inequality (<ref>) following Definition <ref>
can be used to give another relationship between
(_i_max,k∈ V) and
(X_i_max∈ V) that, together with
Inequality (<ref>), will be of critical importance in
Section <ref>.

Proposition <ref> follows from the two lemmas below, so
long as ϵ_1 is chosen suitably small with respect to ϵ_0,
, and r.


We have

    ∑_V∈(): V is unexceptional(A_V)≤
    p^-n 2^n ϵ_1^ϵ_0 n/r.




 

We have

    ∑_V∈(): V is exceptional(A_V)≤
    n^- n2 +  n.



We will prove Lemma <ref> in
Section <ref>, and we will prove Lemma <ref> in Section <ref>.



 §.§ The unexceptional medium combinatorial dimension case



The general idea for the case of an unexceptional hyperplane V is to replace
some of the rows X_i in the matrix  with rows that concentrate
more sharply on the subspace V.  In the case where the exponent r=1,
replacing a row X_i with
Y_i:=(_i,1,…,_i,n) is
successful; however, in the exponent r= 2 case, for example, replacing the
entire row results in a bound that is off by an exponential factor.
We solve this problem by replacing X_i with only
half of Y_i (with the other half of the entries being zero).
This idea easily extends to any integer r ≥ 2 and is the
motivation for defining the vectors _i,k to have all zeros except
for roughly n/r coordinates, as is done in Equation (<ref>).  The
basic utility of _i_0,k_0 (from Definition <ref>) is that
it concentrates more sharply on the unexceptional subspace V than the vector
X_i for any i.  

 
Let _i_0,k_0 be the vector from the definition of unexceptional
(Definition <ref>) such that (X_i ∈ V) < ϵ_1
(_i_0,k_0∈ V) for every i, and set
:=_i_0,j_0.  Let m be the closest integer to
ϵ_0 nr, where  is a small positive
absolute constant (for example, in <cit.>,  is taken to be
1/100).  Finally, let _1, …, _m be copies of
, independent of each other and of X_1, …, X_n.  



Let B_V,m be the event that _1, …, _m are linearly
independent and lie in V.  Then,

    (B_V,m) ≥ p^n_1≤ i≤
    n(X_i ∈ V)ϵ_1^m




The argument follows the same reasoning as <cit.>, however,
the quantity 2^-n in <cit.> should be replaced by _1≤
i≤ n(X_i ∈ V).

Details are provided in Appendix <ref>.


To conclude the proof of Lemma <ref>, we follow the 
“row-swapping” argument at the end of <cit.>, with the small
change of bounding (X_i ∈ V) by _1≤
i≤ n(X_i ∈ V), which we use in place of the quantity
2^-n.
Details are provided in Appendix <ref>.




§ ANALYZING THE  EXCEPTIONAL MEDIUM COMBINATORIAL DIMENSION
CASE


The approach for exceptional V in <cit.> is very different from that
used in the unexceptional case or in the large or small combinatorial
dimension cases. Using some powerful tools from additive combinatorics, the
general idea is to put exceptional hyperplanes V in correspondence with a
particular additive structure called a , and then to show that
the number of the particular s that arise in this way is exceedingly
small.  The key to this approach is a structure theorem—namely,
<cit.>. In this section, we state a slightly modified
structure theorem (Theorem <ref>), and then we show
how to use Theorem <ref> to prove Lemma <ref>.  In the beginning of Section <ref>, we outline the changes needed to
prove the the structure theorem for our current context, and in
Sections <ref> and <ref> we provide details. 

Before stating the structure theorem, we need some definitions and notation.
A B_MATH_TERM of rank  is a set of the form

    P = {v_0 + m_1 v_1 + ⋯ + m_: m_i≤ M_i/2},

where the B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM v_0,v_1,…,v_ are elements of a
-module (here, ) and where the B_MATH_TERM M_1,…,
M_ are positive integers.  We say that v_i has corresponding
dimension M_i.  For a given element a = v_0 + m_1 v_1 + ⋯ + m_
in P, we refer to m_1,…, m_ as B_MATH_TERM for a.  A
 P is B_MATH_TERM if v_0=0, and P is B_MATH_TERM if for each
a∈ P, the there is a unique -tuple (m_1,…, m_) with
m_i< M_i/2 that gives the coefficients for a.  

If P is proper and symmetric, we define the P-norm a of an element a∈ P to be

    a := ( ∑_i=1^m_iM_i^2 )^1/2.


We will use the notation m P, where m is a positive integer, to denote the
set {∑_i=1^m x_i : x_i∈ P} and the notation P^m, where m is a
positive integer, to denote the set {∏_i=1^m x_i : x_i ∈ P}.  If
P is a  of rank , then so is mP, while P^m, on the other
hand, is a  of rank at most ^m.  Also note that mP≤ m^ P and that P^m≤P^m. 

Let V be an exceptional hyperplane of  medium combinatorial dimension in () and let  = (α_1,…,α_n) be the exceptional row
(here we are using α_j as shorthand for α_,j).  Let
(_1,…,_n) be the row of  random variables
corresponding to  from the definition of  of exponent r,
and let b_j,s with 1≤ j≤ n and 1≤ s≤ℓ_j be the values
taken by _j (see Equation (<ref>) for the definition
of _j).

Given an exceptional hyperplane V, there exists a representation of the form 

    V ={(x_1, x_2, …, x_n) ∈ ()^n  :  
     x_1 a_1 + x_2a_2 +
    ⋯ + x_na_n =0 }

for some elements a_1, a _2, …, a_n ∈.  We will call a_1,
a_2, …, a_n the  B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM of V.  

Finally, let ã_j:=  a_j.  We will
refer to (ã_1,…,ã_n) as the scaled defining
coordinates of V .  Note that once  is fixed, so are the elements
.  We should also note that the choice of 
among b_j,s for 1≤ s ≤ℓ_j is arbitrary—since _j
takes the values b_j,s each with probability at least q, any value of
s will do; and so we have taken s=1 for convenience.

Let H denote the B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM , that is, those numbers in
 of the form a/b  Q where a,b are integers such that a,  b
≤ n^o(n) and b  0.  The highly rational
numbers were defined in <cit.>, and we will need a small
extension for the current paper, due to the fact that we are using the scaled
defining coordinates of V instead of simply the defining coordinates of V.
If we were to assume that  was an O(1) integer for all j and that
every possible value taken by α_ij was an O(1) integer for all
i,j, then we could still use the same definition of highly rational as in
<cit.>. However, if there is a  or an entry α_ij in the
matrix  that ever takes an irrational value, then when we pass
to  using Lemma <ref> we have to account for values
possibly on the order of Q (see Remark <ref>), and the highly
rational numbers are not sufficient for this task.  We can overcome this
difficulty by extending to the highly T-rational numbers, which
contain the highly rational numbers along with all the values in a structured
set T (described below). 




We will now give a rigorous definition the highly T-rational
numbers.

Let T be a  in  with rank O(1) and having cardinality at most
n^o(n).  As in the definition of  of exponent r
(Definition <ref>), we will take  to be
the  containing all possible values in  taken by the random
variables α_ij that are the entries of ; thus, by
assumption ≤ n^o(n).  By the definition of , we know
that all of the random variables _ij take values in a set with
cardinality O(1).  Thus, there is a symmetric  T with rank O(1) and
cardinality T≤ n^o(n) such that T contains S, such that T
contains the set {-1,0,1}, and such that T contains all the values taken
by the _ij.  To construct T from S, one can, for example,
add each distinct value taken by a _ij as a new basis vector
v' with corresponding dimension M':= 3 (say).

A B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM h is any element of  of the form
a/b, where a,b ∈ n^o(n) T^O(1).  Note that therefore, the
cardinality of the  numbers is at most (n^d o(n)T)^O(1) =
n^o(n), where d=O(1) is the rank of T (here we used the fact that
T≤ n^o(n)).


There is a constant C=C(,ϵ_0,ϵ_1,ϵ_2,q,r,μ) such
that the following holds.  Let V be an exceptional hyperplane and let
ã_1, …, ã_n be its  scaled defining coordinates (as
described above).  Then there exist integers

	1≤≤C

and M_1,…, M_≥ 1 with the volume bound

M_1 ⋯M_≤C(∈V)^-1

and nonzero elements v_1,…, v_∈ such that the following
holds


  * 
(i)  (Scaled defining coordinates lie in a progression) The
symmetric 
	P:= {m_1v_1+⋯+m_v_: -M_i/2 < m_i < M_i/2 }

is proper and contains all of the ã_j.


  * 
(ii)
(Bounded norm) The ã_j have small P-norm:

	∑_j=1^n ã_j^2 ≤C.


  * 
(iii)
(Rational T-commensurability)
The set {v_1,…,v_}∪{ã_1,…, ã_n} is
contained in the set 

	{ h v_1: }.

Here $S_{|\mu|}$ is the group of permutations of~$|\mu|$ elements,
$C_2(S_{|\mu|})$ denotes the set of all transpositions in~$S_{|\mu|}$,
and $C_\mu(S_{|\mu|})$ is the set of all permutations of cyclic type~$\mu\vdash |\mu|$ in~$S_{|\mu|}$.
(The \textit{cyclic type} of a permutation is the set of lengths of the cycles
in its decomposition in a product of independent cycles;
it forms a partition of the number of permuted elements). In particular,
$$
C_2(S_{|\mu|})=C_{1^{|\mu|-2}2^1}(S_{|\mu|}).
$$
In other words, simple Hurwitz numbers enumerate decompositions of
a given permutation into a product of a given number of transpositions,
in terms of the cyclic type of the permutation.

In order to associate a multiplicity to a lattice path subdivision $\mathcal{S}$ in $\mathcal{S}_2(\mathcal{A})$, define
\begin{align*}
\mult_{\ev}(\mathcal{S}):=\prod_{P} \mult_{\ev}(P),
\end{align*}
where the product goes over all valid polytopes and pointed segments in $\mathcal{S}$, and $\mult(P)$ is defined as follows: If $\tilde{P}$ is $0$-dimensional or $P\in\mathcal{A}$, then $\mult(P):=1$. Otherwise let $\tau_1,\dots,\tau_m$ denote the entries of labelings of edges of $P$ associated to $\tilde{P}$, let $\mathcal{E}_i$ be the number of ends that can be reached from $P$ via $\tau_i$ and let $\mathcal{C}_i$ be the number of constraints that can be reached from $P$ via $\tau_i$ (using the procedure from definition \ref{definition:CR_fit}), that is
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{C}_i&:=\mathcal{C}_i^{\left(\textrm{points}\right)}+\mathcal{C}_i^{\left(\textrm{cross-ratios}\right)},\\
\mathcal{C}_i^{\left(\textrm{cross-ratios}\right)}&:= \sum_{P'} \#\Lambda(P'),

We have either $\mathcal{E}_i-1=\mathcal{C}_i$ or
$\mathcal{E}_i-2=\mathcal{C}_i$: in the first case, the edge dual to $\tau_i$ in the tropical curve leads to a fixed component, in the second to a free component (see definition \ref{definition:fixed_free_components}). Every vertex of the dual tropical curve has exactly two fixed components, we use the indices $i_0$ and $i_1$ for those labels corresponding to edges in the dual tropical curve that lead to a fixed component. Then we set
\begin{align*}
\mult_{\ev}(P):=|\det\left(\tau_{i_0}\cdot v_0, \tau_{i_1}\cdot v_1 \right)|,
\end{align*}
where $v_0$ is the primitive vector of the edge $E_0$ of $P$ that belongs to $\tau_{i_0}$ and $v_1$, respectively.

Furthermore let $C_\mathcal{S}$ be the dual tropical curve of $\mathcal{S}$ (see construction \ref{construction:dual_tropical_curve}). Let $X:=\prod_{j=1}^{l}\ft_{\lambda_j}^*\left( 0\right)\cdot\mathcal{M}_{0,n}\left(\mathbb{R}^2,\Delta(\Sigma) \right)$. Note that $C_\mathcal{S}\in X$ since the lattice path subdivision $\mathcal{S}$ fits the cross-ratios $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_l$. Moreover, $C_\mathcal{S}$ passes through the points $p_1,\dots,p_n$ by construction \ref{construction:dual_tropical_curve}. Using remark \ref{corollary:mult_ev_well-def}, we know that $C_\mathcal{S}$ lies in the interior of a top-dimensional cell of $X$. Denote this top-dimensional cell by $\sigma_\mathcal{S}$ and define $\omega (\sigma_\mathcal{S})$ to be its weight. Recall that this weight has a local structure, see corollary \ref{corollary:resolution_weights_local}.

We define the \textit{multiplicity $\mult(\mathcal{S} )$ of $\mathcal{S}$} as
\begin{align*}
\mult(\mathcal{S}):=\mult_{\ev}(\mathcal{S})\cdot \omega (\sigma_\mathcal{S}).

 A \emph{family on $\ZZ_m^n \times \{0,1\}^\ell$} is a subset of $\ZZ_m^n \times \{0,1\}^\ell$. Such a family $\cF$ is \emph{$t$-agreeing up~to~$s$} if every $x,y \in \cF$ have $t$ coordinates $i_1,\ldots,i_t$ such that $x_{i_j} - y_{i_j} \in \{-(s-1),\ldots,s-1\}$ (if $i_j \leq n$) or $x_{i_j} = y_{i_j} = 1$ (if $i_j > n$) for $1 \leq j \leq t$.
 
 More generally, two vectors $x,y \in \ZZ_m^n \times \{0,1\}^\ell$ $s$-agree on a coordinate $i \leq n$ if $x_i - y_i \in \{-(s-1),\ldots,s-1\}$, and they $s$-agree on a coordinate $i > n$ if $x_i = y_i = 1$. Thus a family on $\ZZ_m^n \times \{0,1\}^\ell$ is $t$-agreeing up~to~$s$ if every $x,y \in \cF$ $s$-agree on at least $t$~coordinates.
 
 We measure families on $\ZZ_m^n \times \{0,1\}^\ell$ using the product measures $\mu_{s,m}^{n,\ell} = \mu_m^n \times \mu_{s/m}^\ell$.
 
 For $y \in \ZZ_m^n$, the mapping $\sigma_y \colon \ZZ_m^n \times \{0,1\}^\ell \to 2^{[n+\ell]}$ is the product of $\sigma_y$ and the identity mapping.

In words, $\cF$ arises from $\cG$ by going through all sets $S \in \cF$, and for each $i \leq n$, replacing each $i \in S$ by all values in $\{y_1+1,\ldots,y_1+s\}$, and each $i \notin S$ by all other values.

An \emph{affine variety} (or more precisely, an \emph{algebraic set} ) in $k^n$ over $k$ is a set $V$ of the form
\begin{equation}\label{vdef}
V =\{ x \in k^n\mid P_1(x) = \ldots = P_m(x) = 0 \}
\end{equation}
for some polynomials $P_1,\ldots,P_m: k^n \to k$.    Similarly, we define the \emph{projective space} $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ to be the space of equivalence classes $[x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}]$ of tuples $(x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}) \in k^{n+1} \backslash \{0\}$ after quotienting out by dilations by $k$, and define a \emph{projective variety} in $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ to be a set $V$ of the form
\begin{equation}\label{vdef-2}
V =\{ x \in \mathbb{P}^n(k)\mid P_1(x) = \ldots = P_m(x) = 0 \}
\end{equation}
for some homogeneous polynomials $P_1,\ldots,P_m: k^{n+1} \to k$ (note that the constraint $P_1(x)=\ldots=P_m(x)=0$ is well-defined in $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$).   We embed $k^n$ in $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ in the usual manner, identifying $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ with $[x_1,\ldots,x_n,1]$; thus for instance every affine variety can be viewed as a subset of an associated projective variety.  

A subset of $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ is said to be a \emph{quasiprojective variety} if it is the set-theoretic difference of two projective varieties in $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$.  Thus for instance the set-theoretic difference of two affine varieties in $k^n$ is a quasiprojective variety.  
A \emph{constructible set} in $k^n$ is a boolean combination of finitely many affine varieties in $k^n$.  As noted in Section \ref{algreg-sec}, constructible sets are definable over $k$ (indeed, as $k$ is algebraically closed, the two concepts coincide in this setting), and so we can inherit the notion of complexity for such sets.  

We define the \emph{Zariski topology} on $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ by declaring the projective varieties to be the closed sets; thus, for instance, the \emph{Zariski closure} $\overline{E}$ of a subset $E$ of $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ is the intersection of all the projective varieties which contain that set.  One can then induce the Zariski topologies on other varieties by restriction.  For instance, in the affine space $k^n$, the Zariski closed sets are given by the affine varieties.

An affine (resp. projective) variety is \emph{geometrically irreducible} , or \emph{irreducible} for short, if it is non-empty and cannot be expressed as the union of two strictly smaller affine (resp. projective) varieties.  We say that a quasiprojective variety (or more generally, a constructible set) is irreducible if its Zariski closure is irreducible.  It is well known (see e.g. \cite[Propositions I.5.2, I.5.3]{mumf}) that any affine (resp. projective) variety can be uniquely decomposed into finitely many irreducible subvarieties, no two of which are contained in each other.  

The \emph{dimension} $\dim(V)$ of a non-empty affine (resp. projective) variety $V$ is the largest natural number $d$ for which there is a chain 
$$ \emptyset \neq V_0 \subsetneq V_1 \subsetneq \ldots \subsetneq V_d \subset V$$
of irreducible affine (resp. projective)  varieties $V_0, \ldots, V_d$; this is always a finite natural number.  We adopt the convention that the empty set has dimension $-\infty$.  The dimension of a quasiprojective variety (in $k^n$ or $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$) is defined to be the dimension of its Zariski closure in the indicated ambient space.  A variety will be called a \emph{curve} if it has dimension one.

If $V,W$ are two varieties with $V \subseteq W$, we say that $V$ is a \emph{subvariety} of $W$.  If $V \subsetneq W$, we say that $V$ is a \emph{strict subvariety} of $W$.

Let $\F$ be a subfield of $k$.  We say that an affine (resp. projective) variety is \emph{defined over $\F$} if one can find polynomials $P_1,\ldots,P_m$ with coefficients in $\F$ for which \eqref{vdef} (resp. \eqref{vdef-2}) holds.  A quasiprojective variety is defined over $\F$ if it is the set-theoretic difference of two affine varieties defined over $\F$.  If $V \subset k^n$ is a quasiprojective variety, we define $V(\F) := V \cap \F^n$ to be the $F$-points of $V$; note that this is a definable subset over $\F$.

Let $V$ be a quasiprojective variety.  If $V \subset k^n$, a \emph{regular function} on $V$ is a function $f: V \to k$ which, at every point $p$ in $V$, agrees with a rational function from (an open dense subset of) $k^n$ to $k$ on an open neighbourhood of $p$ in $V$.  If instead $V \subset \mathbb{P}^n(k)$, a regular function on $V$ is a function which is regular when restricted to the $n+1$ affine subsets $\{ [x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}] \in \mathbb{P}^n(k)\mid x_i \neq 0 \}$, $i=1,\ldots,n+1$ that cover ${\mathbb P}^n(k)$, each of which can be identified with the affine space $k^n$ in the obvious manner.  The ring of regular functions on $V$ is denoted $k[V]$, and its fraction field (which is well defined for irreducible $V$) is denoted $k(V)$.  A map $\phi: V \to W$ between two quasiprojective varieties is a \emph{regular morphism} if every regular function on $W$ pulls back by $\phi$ to a regular function on $V$.  A \emph{regular isomorphism} is an invertible regular morphism whose inverse is also regular.

    V ={ x ∈ k^n| P_1(x) = … = P_m(x) = 0 }

for some polynomials P_1,…,P_m: k^n → k.    Similarly, we define the projective space ℙ^n(k) to be the space of equivalence classes [x_1,…,x_n+1] of tuples (x_1,…,x_n+1) ∈ k^n+1\{0} after quotienting out by dilations by k, and define a projective variety in ℙ^n(k) to be a set V of the form

We embed k^n in ℙ^n(k) in the usual manner, identifying (x_1,…,x_n) with [x_1,…,x_n,1]; thus for instance every affine variety can be viewed as a subset of an associated projective variety.  

A subset of ℙ^n(k) is said to be a quasiprojective variety if it is the set-theoretic difference of two projective varieties in ℙ^n(k).  Thus for instance the set-theoretic difference of two affine varieties in k^n is a quasiprojective variety.  
A constructible set in k^n is a boolean combination of finitely many affine varieties in k^n.  As noted in Section <ref>, constructible sets are definable over k (indeed, as k is algebraically closed, the two concepts coincide in this setting), and so we can inherit the notion of complexity for such sets.  

We define the Zariski topology on ℙ^n(k) by declaring the projective varieties to be the closed sets; thus, for instance, the Zariski closure E of a subset E of ℙ^n(k) is the intersection of all the projective varieties which contain that set.

The dimension (V) of a non-empty affine (resp. projective) variety V is the largest natural number d for which there is a chain 

    ∅≠ V_0 ⊊ V_1 ⊊…⊊ V_d ⊂ V

of irreducible affine (resp. projective)  varieties V_0, …, V_d; this is always a finite natural number.  We adopt the convention that the empty set has dimension -∞.  The dimension of a quasiprojective variety (in k^n or ℙ^n(k)) is defined to be the dimension of its Zariski closure in the indicated ambient space.  A variety will be called a curve if it has dimension one.

If V,W are two varieties with V ⊆ W, we say that V is a subvariety of W.  If V ⊊ W, we say that V is a strict subvariety of W.

Let  be a subfield of k.  We say that an affine (resp. projective) variety is defined over  if one can find polynomials P_1,…,P_m with coefficients in  for which (<ref>) (resp. (<ref>)) holds.  A quasiprojective variety is defined over  if it is the set-theoretic difference of two affine varieties defined over .  If V ⊂ k^n is a quasiprojective variety, we define V() := V ∩^n to be the F-points of V; note that this is a definable subset over .

Let V be a quasiprojective variety.  If V ⊂ k^n, a regular function on V is a function f: V → k which, at every point p in V, agrees with a rational function from (an open dense subset of) k^n to k on an open neighbourhood of p in V.  If instead V ⊂ℙ^n(k), a regular function on V is a function which is regular when restricted to the n+1 affine subsets { [x_1,…,x_n+1] ∈ℙ^n(k)| x_i ≠ 0 }, i=1,…,n+1 that cover ℙ^n(k), each of which can be identified with the affine space k^n in the obvious manner.  The ring of regular functions on V is denoted k[V], and its fraction field (which is well defined for irreducible V) is denoted k(V).  A map ϕ: V → W between two quasiprojective varieties is a regular morphism if every regular function on W pulls back by ϕ to a regular function on V.  A regular isomorphism is an invertible regular morphism whose inverse is also regular.

An B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM (or more precisely, an B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM ) in k^n over k is a set V of the form

    V ={ x ∈ k^n| P_1(x) = … = P_m(x) = 0 }

for some polynomials P_1,…,P_m: k^n → k.    Similarly, we define the B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM ℙ^n(k) to be the space of equivalence classes [x_1,…,x_n+1] of tuples (x_1,…,x_n+1) ∈ k^n+1\{0} after quotienting out by dilations by k, and define a B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM in ℙ^n(k) to be a set V of the form

    V ={ x ∈ℙ^n(k)| P_1(x) = … = P_m(x) = 0 }

for some homogeneous polynomials P_1,…,P_m: k^n+1→ k (note that the constraint P_1(x)=…=P_m(x)=0 is well-defined in ℙ^n(k)).   We embed k^n in ℙ^n(k) in the usual manner, identifying (x_1,…,x_n) with [x_1,…,x_n,1]; thus for instance every affine variety can be viewed as a subset of an associated projective variety.  

A subset of ℙ^n(k) is said to be a B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM if it is the set-theoretic difference of two projective varieties in ℙ^n(k).  Thus for instance the set-theoretic difference of two affine varieties in k^n is a quasiprojective variety.  
A B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM in k^n is a boolean combination of finitely many affine varieties in k^n.  As noted in Section <ref>, constructible sets are definable over k (indeed, as k is algebraically closed, the two concepts coincide in this setting), and so we can inherit the notion of complexity for such sets.  

We define the B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM on ℙ^n(k) by declaring the projective varieties to be the closed sets; thus, for instance, the B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM E of a subset E of ℙ^n(k) is the intersection of all the projective varieties which contain that set.  One can then induce the Zariski topologies on other varieties by restriction.  For instance, in the affine space k^n, the Zariski closed sets are given by the affine varieties.

An affine (resp. projective) variety is B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM , or B_MATH_TERM for short, if it is non-empty and cannot be expressed as the union of two strictly smaller affine (resp. projective) varieties.  We say that a quasiprojective variety (or more generally, a constructible set) is irreducible if its Zariski closure is irreducible.  It is well known (see e.g. <cit.>) that any affine (resp. projective) variety can be uniquely decomposed into finitely many irreducible subvarieties, no two of which are contained in each other.  

The B_MATH_TERM (V) of a non-empty affine (resp. projective) variety V is the largest natural number d for which there is a chain 

    ∅≠ V_0 ⊊ V_1 ⊊…⊊ V_d ⊂ V

of irreducible affine (resp. projective)  varieties V_0, …, V_d; this is always a finite natural number.  We adopt the convention that the empty set has dimension -∞.  The dimension of a quasiprojective variety (in k^n or ℙ^n(k)) is defined to be the dimension of its Zariski closure in the indicated ambient space.  A variety will be called a B_MATH_TERM if it has dimension one.

If V,W are two varieties with V ⊆ W, we say that V is a B_MATH_TERM of W.  If V ⊊ W, we say that V is a B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM of W.

Let  be a subfield of k.  We say that an affine (resp. projective) variety is B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM if one can find polynomials P_1,…,P_m with coefficients in  for which (<ref>) (resp. (<ref>)) holds.  A quasiprojective variety is defined over  if it is the set-theoretic difference of two affine varieties defined over .  If V ⊂ k^n is a quasiprojective variety, we define V() := V ∩^n to be the F-points of V; note that this is a definable subset over .

Let V be a quasiprojective variety.  If V ⊂ k^n, a B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM on V is a function f: V → k which, at every point p in V, agrees with a rational function from (an open dense subset of) k^n to k on an open neighbourhood of p in V.  If instead V ⊂ℙ^n(k), a regular function on V is a function which is regular when restricted to the n+1 affine subsets { [x_1,…,x_n+1] ∈ℙ^n(k)| x_i ≠ 0 }, i=1,…,n+1 that cover ℙ^n(k), each of which can be identified with the affine space k^n in the obvious manner.  The ring of regular functions on V is denoted k[V], and its fraction field (which is well defined for irreducible V) is denoted k(V).  A map ϕ: V → W between two quasiprojective varieties is a B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM if every regular function on W pulls back by ϕ to a regular function on V.  A B_MATH_TERM I_MATH_TERM is an invertible regular morphism whose inverse is also regular.

Equivalently, we set $C>D$ if $f$ is a positive element of $C$ and not an element of $D$, or $f$ is a positive element of $C$ and a negative element of $D$, or $f$ is not an element of $C$ and a negative element of $D$, where $f$ is the smallest possible element of $F$ that allows for setting $C<D$ or $D<C$ by this way.

Equivalently, it is easy to see that this ordering is provided by the weight function $w$ on signed cocycles of $G$
defined as follows. 
Denote $F=f_2<...<f_r$, and denote $f_i$ resp. $\bar f_i$ the element with a positive resp. negative sign. 
For $1\leq i\leq r$, set
$w(f_i)=2^{r-i}$ and $w(\bar f_i)=-2^{r-i}$, and set $w(e)=0$ if $e\in E\setminus F$. Then define the weight $w(C)$ of a signed cocycle $C$ as the sum  of weights of its elements. The above linear ordering is

For any polynomial map $g \in \poly(\Z_\N \to G_\N)$, we define the \emph{$i^{th}$ horizontal Taylor coefficient} $\Taylor_i(g) \in \Horiz_i(G)$ to be the quantity

If $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of $G$, we define

These concepts extend to the ultralimit setting in the obvious manner; thus for instance, if $\orbit \in \ultra \poly(H_\N \to (G/\Gamma)_\N)$, then $\Taylor_i(\orbit)$ is an element to $\ultra \Horiz_i(G/\Gamma)$.

  Let $k$ be a positive integer, let $G$ be a graph, and let $v_1,\dots,v_k\in V(G)$ be distinct vertices.
  The \emph{WL-tree unfolding at $(v_1,\dots,v_k)$} is the tree-decomposed graph~$(F,T)$ that is constructed together with a bag-wise isomorphic homomorphism~$\pi$ from~$(F,T)$ to~$G$ as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      We start with $F$ having~$k$ vertices~$1,\dots,k$ and~$T$ being the trivial tree
      decomposition with a single bag~$\beta(t):=V(F)$ at the unique node~$t\in
      V(T)$.
      Let $\pi: V(F)\to \set{v_1,\dots,v_k}$ be the function with $\pi(i)=v_i$ for $i\in\set{1,\dots,k}$.
      Let the edges of $F$ be chosen such that $\pi$ is an isomorphism from $F$ to~$G[\set{v_1,\dots,v_k}]$.
    \item\textit{(Introduce nodes)}
      If $t$ is a leaf node of~$T$ with $\abs{\beta(t)}=k$, then for each $w\in V(G)$ with~$w\not\in \pi(\beta(t))$, we do the following:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item
          Add a fresh child node~$t_w$ to~$t$ in~$T$.
        \item
          Add a fresh vertex~$f$ to~$F$ and extend~$\pi$ with $[f\mapsto w]$
        \item
          Let the bag of~$t_w$ be defined via
          $\beta(t_w)=\beta(t)\cup\set{f}$.
        \item
          Add edges between~$f$ and~$\beta(t)$ to~$F$ in the unique way so that~$\pi$ is an isomorphism from~$F[\beta(t_w)]$ to~$G[\pi(\beta(t_w))]$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item\textit{(Forget nodes)}
      If $t$ is a leaf node of~$T$ with $\abs{\beta(t)}=k+1$, then for each $j\in\set{1,\dots,k}$, we do the following:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item
          Add a fresh child node~$t_j$ of~$t$ to~$T$.
        \item
          Let $f$ be the vertex that was introduced at~$t$, that is, we have $\beta(t')\setminus\beta(t)=\set{f}$ for the parent~$t'$ of~$t$.
        \item 
          Let $\set{f_1,\dots,f_k}=\beta(t)\setminus\set{f}$ where the $f_i$ are sorted in a canonical way.
        \item
          We define $\beta(t_j):=\beta(t)\setminus\set{f_j}$.
      \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
  Clearly, applying rules (2) and (3) above a finite number of times constructs a tree-decomposed graph~$(F,T)$ and a bag-wise isomorphic homomorphism~$\pi$.
  If we exhaustively expand leaves of~$T$ at depth less than~$d$ and then stop the process, all leaves of the final tree~$T$ are at depth~$d$ and we say that $(F,T)$ is \emph{the depth-$d$ WL-tree unfolding of~$G$ at~$\bar v$} .

  For all tree-decomposed graphs~$(F,T)$, let
  $\wl( (F,T), G)$ be the number of tuples $\bar v:= (v_1,\dots,v_k)$ of vertices in~$G$ for which the WL-tree unfolding~$(F',T')$ at $\bar v$ is isomorphic to~$(F,T)$.

Otherwise, leth(x) = max{c, y(p_j)} + (x-x(p_j)) min{d, y(p_j+1)} -y(p_j)x(p_j+1) - max{c, y(p_j)} .

We defineh^↑n(x)to be ay-valuennotches above( x, h(x) )with respect tosuch thatc ≤y < d.
Let(a,b)be the rowmax{0,n}notches above( x, h(x) )with respect to.
If this row does not exist or ifa ≥d, thenh^↑n(x)is undefined.
Otherwise, we defineh^↑n(x) = max{ c,   a + min{b,d} 2 }.

%\label{thm:singleton_b_is_a_prime}
\emph{Statement of Theorem \ref{thm:singleton_b_is_a_prime}:} Let $n$ be a positive integer. Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a fractional $L$-intersecting families of subsets of $[n]$, where $L=\{\frac{a}{b}\}$, $\frac{a}{b} \in [0, 1)$, and $b$ is a prime. Then, $|\mathcal{G}| \leq (b-1)(n+1)\lceil \frac{\ln n}{\ln b} \rceil + 1$.
\begin{proof}
\rogers{It is easy to see that if $a=0$, then $|\mathcal{G}| \leq n$ with the set of all singleton subsets of $[n]$ forming a tight example to this bound. So assume $a \neq 0$. Let $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{G}\setminus \mathcal{H}$, where $\mathcal{H} = \{A \in \mathcal{G}~:~b \nmid |A|\}$. From the definition of a fractional $\frac{a}{b}$-intersecting family it is clear that $|\mathcal{H}|\leq 1$. The rest of the proof is to show that $|\mathcal{F}| \leq (b-1)(n+1)\lceil \frac{\ln n}{\ln b} \rceil$. We do this by partitioning $\mathcal{F}$ into $(b-1)\lceil \log_b n \rceil$ parts and then showing that each part is of size at most $n+1$.} We define $F_i^j$ as 
	\[\mathcal{F}_i^j= \{A \in \mathcal{F}| |A| \equiv j \Mod i\}.\]
Since $b$ divides $|A|$, for every $A \in \mathcal{F}$, under this definition $\mathcal{F}$ can be partitioned into families $\mathcal{F}_{b^k}^{ib^{k-1}}$, where $2 \leq k \leq \lceil \log_b n \rceil$ and $1 \leq i \leq b-1$. We show that, for every $i \in [b-1]$ and for every $2 \leq k \leq \lceil \log_b n\rceil$, $|\mathcal{F}_{b^k}^{ib^{k-1}}| \leq n+1$.       	

In order to estimate $|\mathcal{F}_{b^k}^{ib^{k-1}}|$, for each $A \in \mathcal{F}_{b^k}^{ib^{k-1}}$, create a vector $X_A$ as follows:

\[X_A(j)=\begin{cases}
	\frac{1}{\sqrt{b^{k-2}}} \text{, if $j \in A$;}\\
	0 \text{, otherwise.}
	\end{cases} \]
	\rogers{Note that, for $A,B \in \mathcal{F}_{b^k}^{ib^{k-1}}$}
	\begin{align}
	\left \langle X_A,X_B\right \rangle \equiv \begin{cases}
	b \Mod {b^2}, \text{ if $A=B$, }\\
	ai \Mod b, \text{ if $A\neq B$, }
	\end{cases}
	\end{align} 
Let $|\mathcal{F}_{b^k}^{ib^{k-1}}| = m$. Let $M_{k,i}$ denote the $m \times n$ matrix formed by taking $X_A$s as rows for each $A \in \mathcal{F}_{b^k}^{ib^{k-1}}$. Then, $|\mathcal{F}_{b^k}^{ib^{k-1}}| \leq n+1$ can be proved by considering $B = M_{k,i} \times M_{k,i}^T$ and showing that $B - aiJ$ (, where $J$ is the $m \times m$ all 1 matrix, ) has full rank; determinant of $B - aiJ$ is non-zero since the only term not divisible by the prime $b$ in the expansion of its determinant comes from the product of all the diagonals (note that $a<b$, $i<b$, and since $b$ is a prime, we have $b \nmid ai$).
\end{proof}
We shall call $\mathcal{F}$ a \emph{bisection closed family} if $\mathcal{F}$ is a fractional $L$-intersecting family where $L=\{\frac{1}{2}\}$. We have two different constructions of families that are bisection closed and are of cardinality $\frac{3n}{2}-2$ on $[n]$. 
\begin{example} 
\label{examp:bisectionClosedEasy}
\rogers{Let $n$ be an even positive integer. 
Let $\mathcal{B}$ denote the collection of 2-sized sets that contain only 1 as a common element in any two sets}, i.e. $\{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, \ldots, \{1,n\}$; and
\rogers{let  $\mathcal{C}$ denote collection of 4-sized sets that contain only $\{1,2\}$ as common elements}, i.e. $\{1,2,3,4\},$ $ \{1,2,5,6\}, \ldots, \{1,2,n-1,n\}$.
It is not hard to see that $\mathcal{B} \cup \mathcal{C}$ is indeed bisection closed.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
\label{examp:Hadamard}
The second example of a bisection closed family of cardinality $\frac{3n}{2}-2$ comes from \emph{Recursive Hadamard matrices} .
A Recursive Hadamard matrix $H(k)$ of size $2^k \times 2^k$ can be obtained from $H(k-1)$ of size $2^{k-1} \times 2^{k-1}$ as follows
\begin{align*}
H(k)= \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
H(k-1) & H(k-1) \\
H(k-1)  & -H(k-1)  \\
\end{array} \right],
\end{align*}
where $H(0)=1$.
Now consider the matrix:
\begin{align*}
M(k)= \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
H(k-1) & H(k-1) \\
H(k-1)  & -H(k-1)  \\
H(k-1) & J(k-1) \\
\end{array} \right], \text{ where $J(k-1)$ denotes the $2^{k-1}\times 2^{k-1}$ all 1s' matrix}.
\end{align*}
Let $M'(k)$ be the matrix obtained from $M(k)$ by removing the \rogers{first and  the }$(2^k+1)$th rows and  replacing the -1's by 1's and 1's by 0's.
$M'(k)$ is clearly bisection closed and has cardinality $\frac{3n}{2}-2$, where $n=2^k$. 
\end{example}
%The two constructions outlined here indicate that the bound given by Theorem \ref{thm:singleton_b_is_a_prime} is asymptotically tight up to a factor of 
%\newline
%\doubt{2. Can we think of other examples where $L=\{a/b\}$ with $a/b \neq 1/2$? (I am bit exhausted!)\\
%3. Wouldn't it be nice if we give our guess on the optimal bound? If so, what would that guess be? Would it be $O(n)$ (I am making this guess in the first para of the next subsection)? \\
%4. When we go from $L = \{1/2\}$ to say $L = \{99/100\}$ (or $L = \{1/100\}$) would the cardinality of $\mathcal{F}$ decrease? Is there any pattern?\niranjan{I think that for any fixed singleton, if the conjecture I made holds, then the bound is in fact $O(n)$ and the constant will also depend on the constant in the rank (in the conjecture. What is probably harder is getting the constant correct. This easy construction gives a constant very close to $1$ whereas the actual answer may be slightly higher; don't know for sure!}}
\subsection{Restricting the cardinalities of the sets in $\mathcal{F}$}
When $L = \{\frac{a}{b}\}$, where $b$ is a prime, Theorem \ref{thm:singleton_b_is_a_prime} yields an upper bound of $O(\frac{b}{\log b} n \log n)$ for $|\mathcal{F}|$. \rogers{However, we believe that when $|L|=1$, the cardinality of any fractional $L$-intersecting family on $[n]$ would be at most $cn$, where $c>0$ is a constant. To this end, we show in Theorem \ref{thm:bound_restricted_size_case} that when the sizes of the sets in $\mathcal{F}$ are restricted, we can achieve this.}  


The following lemma is crucial to the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:bound_restricted_size_case}. 
\begin{lemma}\cite{alon2009perturbed,CODENOTTI200089}
	Let $A$ be an $m \times m$ real symmetric matrix with $a_{i,i}=1$ and $|a_{i,j}| \leq \epsilon$ for all $i \neq j$. 
	Let $tr(A)$ denote the trace of $A$, i.e., the sum of the diagonal entries of A. 
	Let $rk(A)$ denote the rank of $A$. Then,
	\[rk(A) \geq \frac{(tr(A))^2}{tr(A^2)}\geq \frac{m}{1+(m-1)\epsilon^2}.\]
	\label{lemma:alon}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\lambda_1, \ldots,\lambda_m$ denote the eigenvalues of $A$. Since only $rk(A)$ eigenvalues of $A$ are non-zero, $(tr(A))^2= (\sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i)^2= (\sum_{i=1}^{rk(A)} \lambda_i)^2 \leq rk(A)\sum_{i=1}^{rk(A)} \lambda_i^2 = rk(A) tr(A^2)$, where the inequality follows from the Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality. Thus, $rk(A) \geq \frac{(tr(A))^2}{tr(A^2)}$. Substituting $tr(A) = m$ and $tr(A^2) = m + m(m-1)\epsilon^2$ in the above inequality proves the theorem.	
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:bound_restricted_size_case}
Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $\delta > 1$. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a fractional $L$-intersecting family of subsets of $[n]$, where $L = \{\frac{a}{b}\}$, $\frac{a}{b} \in [0,1)$ is an irreducible fraction and for every $A \in \mathcal{F}$, $|A|$ in an integer in the range $\left[\frac{b}{4(b-a)}n - \frac{b}{4a\delta}\sqrt{n}, \frac{b}{4(b-a)}n + \frac{b}{4a\delta}\sqrt{n}\right]$. Then, $|\mathcal{F}| < \frac{\delta^2}{\delta^2 - 1}n$.

It is easy to see that if a=0, then |ùí¢| ‚â§ n with the set of all singleton subsets of [n] forming a tight example to this bound. So assume a ‚â† 0. Let ‚Ñ± = ùí¢‚àñ‚Ñã, where ‚Ñã = {A ‚ààùí¢¬†:¬†b ‚à§ |A|}. From the definition of a fractional a/b-intersecting family it is clear that |‚Ñã|‚â§ 1. The rest of the proof is to show that |‚Ñ±| ‚â§ (b-1)(n+1)‚åàln n/ln b‚åâ. We do this by partitioning ‚Ñ± into (b-1)‚åàlog_b n ‚åâ parts and then showing that each part is of size at most n+1. We define F_i^j as

We shall call ‚Ñ± a bisection closed family if ‚Ñ± is a fractional L-intersecting family where L={1/2}. We have two different constructions of families that are bisection closed and are of cardinality 3n/2-2 on [n]. 
 

Let n be an even positive integer.

It is not hard to see that ‚Ñ¨‚à™ùíû is indeed bisection closed.



The second example of a bisection closed family of cardinality 3n/2-2 comes from Recursive Hadamard matrices .
A Recursive Hadamard matrix H(k) of size 2^k √ó 2^k can be obtained from H(k-1) of size 2^k-1√ó 2^k-1 as follows

    H(k)= [ [  H(k-1)  H(k-1);  H(k-1) -H(k-1);         ]],

where H(0)=1.
Now consider the matrix:

    M(k)= [ [  H(k-1)  H(k-1);  H(k-1) -H(k-1);  H(k-1)  J(k-1);         ]],  where J(k-1) denotes the 2^k-1√ó 2^k-1 all 1s' matrix.

Let M'(k) be the matrix obtained from M(k) by removing the first and  the (2^k+1)th rows and  replacing the -1's by 1's and 1's by 0's.
M'(k) is clearly bisection closed and has cardinality 3n/2-2, where n=2^k.

  For a reduced word $\rho$, define the \emph{weak descent composition of $\rho$} , denoted by $\des(\rho)$, as follows. Let $(\rho^{(k)} | \cdots | \rho^{(1)})$ be the run decomposition of $\rho$, that is, each $\rho^{(i)}$ is increasing and as long as possible. Set $r_i = \min(\rho^{(i)})$ for $i=1,\ldots,k$.

	A graph consisting of a cycle $C$	and a vertex $w$ with at least three edges between $C$ and $w$ is called a \textit{pyramid} . Such vertex $w$ is called an \textit{apex} of the pyramid. A graph is called a \textit{trihedron} if it is a union of three paths $P_{1},P_{2},P_{3}$ that start and end at the same points such that each interior points of each paths are not used in any other path. A graph is called a \textit{stamp} if it is the union of a triangle $T$ and three paths $P_{1},P_{2},P_{3}$ of length $\ge 1$ such that the three paths starts from three different vertices of $T$ and ends at the same vertex $x$, and $P_{i}-x$ are vertex-disjoint. A graph $S$ is called a $\textit{prism}$ if $S=T\cup T' \cup P_{1}\cup P_{2}\cup P_{3}$ where $T,T'$ are vertex-disjoint triangles with vertices $x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}$ and $y_{1},y_{2},y_{3}$ respectively, and $P_{i}$s are vertex-disjoint paths from $x_{i}$ to $y_{i}$. The four graphs are described below.

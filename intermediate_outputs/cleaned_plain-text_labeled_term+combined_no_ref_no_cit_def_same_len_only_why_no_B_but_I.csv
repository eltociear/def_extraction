Let $\Dcal$ be a labeled floor diagram of degree~$d$ and genus~$g$. 
Let $\lambda$ and $\rho$ be two partitions with $|\lambda|+|\rho|=d$.
A~$(\lambda,\rho)$-marking of~$\Dcal$ is a combinatorial decoration
of~$\Dcal$ obtained by the following modification of the procedure
used in Definition~\ref{def-marking}. 
We will illustrate the steps of this procedure using a running

by a single edge directed away from~$v$.
In addition, introduce some (possibly none) edges directed from $v$
to $v_1,\dots,v_{\ell(\lambda)}$. 
Assign positive integer weights to all these new edges, so that
\begin{itemize}
\item
for each original vertex $v$ in~$\Dcal$, 
the total weight of all new edges (of both kinds) originating
at~$v$ is equal to $1-\divv(v)$;
\item
the weights of all edges arriving at $v_1,\dots,v_{\ell(\lambda)}$ 
%(from all vertices~$v$) 
form the partition~$\lambda$; 
\item
the weights of all other new edges form the partition~$\rho$.

Step 0.
Introduce ℓ(λ) new vertices denoted
v_1,…,v_ℓ(λ):  

    (80,20)(30,-4)(25,1.5)(0,0)2(7,0)(1,0)1(17.5,1.75)(2,-1)1(17.5,-1.75)(2,1)1(27,0)(1,0)1(40,0)2(40,0)*1(42,2)(0,0)v_1


Step 1.
For each original vertex v in , introduce some number (possibly none)
of additional new vertices, and connect v to each of them 
by a single edge directed away from v.
In addition, introduce some (possibly none) edges directed from v
to v_1,…,v_ℓ(λ). 
Assign positive integer weights to all these new edges, so that


  * for each original vertex v in , 
the total weight of all new edges (of both kinds) originating
at v is equal to 1-(v);

  * the weights of all edges arriving at v_1,…,v_ℓ(λ) 

form the partition λ; 

  * the weights of all other new edges form the partition ρ. 
















Thus, the total weight of all new edges is
equal to ∑_v (1-(v))=d=|λ|+|ρ|.

Step 2.
Split each original edge e of  in two,
by inserting an extra vertex in the middle of e;
the resulting two edges inherit e's orientation and weight.

Let G=(V,E) denote the acyclic
directed graph obtained after Steps 1–2.

Step 3.
Extend the linear ordering on the vertices of  to the
set V 

so that, as before, each edge in E
is directed from a smaller to a larger vertex.
We also require v_1 to be the maximal element under
the linear ordering, v_2 the second largest, etc.:

-coalgebra homomorphism,"
\label{def.kA-coalg}Let $A$ be a commutative $\mathbf{k}$-algebra.

\textbf{(a)} Let $H$ be a $\mathbf{k}$-module, and let $G$ be an $A$-module.
For any $\mathbf{k}$-linear map $f:H\rightarrow G$, we let $f^{\sharp}$ denote
the $A$-linear map%
\[
\underline{A}\otimes H\rightarrow G,\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ a\otimes h\mapsto
af\left(  h\right)  .
\]
(It is easy to see that this latter map is indeed well-defined and
$A$-linear.) For any $A$-linear map $g:\underline{A}\otimes H\rightarrow G$,
we let $g^{\flat}$ denote the $\mathbf{k}$-linear map%
\[
H\rightarrow G,\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ h\mapsto g\left(  1\otimes h\right)  .
\]


Sometimes we will use the notations $f^{\sharp\left(  A,\mathbf{k}\right)  }$
and $g^{\flat\left(  A,\mathbf{k}\right)  }$ instead of $f^{\sharp}$ and
$g^{\flat}$ when the $A$ and the $\mathbf{k}$ are not clear from the context.

It is easy to see that $\left(  f^{\sharp}\right)  ^{\flat}=f$ for any
$\mathbf{k}$-linear map $f:H\rightarrow G$, and that $\left(  g^{\flat
}\right)  ^{\sharp}=g$ for any $A$-linear map $g:\underline{A}\otimes
H\rightarrow G$. Thus, the maps%
\begin{align}

This is a particular case of an adjunction between functors (namely, the

  (a) (z_1, …, z_m) is an increasing sequence, that is x_i < x_i+1 and y_i < y_i+1 for all i ∈ [m-1].

  (b) Every point in the sequence is contained in some rectangle R_j with j∈[K]. In other words, (j-1)Δ x < x_i ≤ j Δ x implies b_j-1Δ y < y_i ≤ (b_j +1) Δ y.

Given a collection of points z = {z_i}_i ∈ [n], let _b(z) denote the length of the longest b-increasing subsequence of z. That is

    _b(z) max{m: ∃ (i_1, i_2, …, i_m)

Discrepancy pair,"\label{def:disc-pair}
Fix a positive integer $\ell$ and a linear form $\xi: \Z^{\ell}\rightarrow\Z$ in $\ell$ variables. Let $S \geq 2$ be a positive integer and $\varepsilon > 0$ be real. For two functions $f,\widetilde{f}: G\rightarrow\R$, we say that $(f,\widetilde{f})$ is an $\varepsilon$-discrepancy pair with width $S$ with respect to $\xi$, if for all functions $u_1, \cdots, u_{\ell} : G^{\ell+1} \rightarrow [-1,1]$ with $u_i$ not depending on the $(i+1)$th coordinate, we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:disc-pair} 
\left| \E_{n \in G} \E_{\ve{s} \in [S]^{\ell}} \left( f(n+\xi(\ve{s})) - \widetilde{f}(n+\xi(\ve{s})) \right) \prod_{i=1}^{\ell} u_i(n,\ve{s}) \right| \leq \varepsilon.

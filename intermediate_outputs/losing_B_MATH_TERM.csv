The \definand{intersection graph} of a chord diagram $C$ is defined as the digraph with a vertex for every chord, and an oriented edge from chord $(a,b)$ to chord $(c,d)$ whenever $a < c < b < d$.
A chord diagram is said to be \definand{connected} (or \emph{irreducible}) if its intersection graph is (weakly) connected.
%\ky{A graph theorist pointed out to me that it should either say ``if its intersection graph is weakly connected'' or ``if its intersection graph is connected as a graph'' because connectivity as a digraph is ambiguous between strongly connected and weakly connected (and even worse, strongly connected would probably be one's first guess).  Which do you prefer?}
%\jc{I just added ""weakly"" in brackets; it should be enough (I prefer not to insist too much on this point, but it's true it needed some corrections). Strong connectivity leads to nothing; our intersections graphs do not have any cycle.}

Floor diagrams marked by pairs of partitions}]
Let $\Dcal$ be a labeled floor diagram of degree~$d$ and genus~$g$. 
Let $\lambda$ and $\rho$ be two partitions with $|\lambda|+|\rho|=d$.
A~$(\lambda,\rho)$-marking of~$\Dcal$ is a combinatorial decoration
of~$\Dcal$ obtained by the following modification of the procedure
used in Definition~\ref{def-marking}. 
We will illustrate the steps of this procedure using a running
example, in which $d=4$, $g=1$, $\lambda=(2)$, $\rho=(1,1)$,
and $\Dcal$ is the labeled floor diagram from
Example~\ref{example:lfd4}:

\textbf{Step~0.}
Introduce $\ell(\lambda)$ new vertices denoted
$v_1,\dots,v_{\ell(\lambda)}$:

\textbf{Step~1.}
For each original vertex $v$ in~$\Dcal$, introduce some number (possibly none)
of additional new vertices, and connect $v$ to each of them 
by a single edge directed away from~$v$.
In addition, introduce some (possibly none) edges directed from $v$
to $v_1,\dots,v_{\ell(\lambda)}$. 
Assign positive integer weights to all these new edges, so that
\begin{itemize}
\item
for each original vertex $v$ in~$\Dcal$, 
the total weight of all new edges (of both kinds) originating
at~$v$ is equal to $1-\divv(v)$;
\item
the weights of all edges arriving at $v_1,\dots,v_{\ell(\lambda)}$ 
%(from all vertices~$v$) 
form the partition~$\lambda$; 
\item
the weights of all other new edges form the partition~$\rho$. 
\end{itemize}
%
%The vertices added 
%at this step will become the \emph{sinks} of the marked diagram.
%We keep track of the edge weights~$w(e)$.

%\textbf{Step~1\sfrac12.}
%Identify a subset $\widetilde V_\lambda\subset\widetilde V$

%The weights of the edges pointing to the sinks in~$\widetilde
%V_\lambda$ must form the partition~$\lambda$. 
%The weights of the edges pointing to the remaining sinks
%must form the partition~$\rho$. 
Thus, the total weight of all new edges is
equal to $\sum_v (1-\divv(v))=d=|\lambda|+|\rho|$.

  *  If d is undammed (which can only happen if n is even), then the (non-propagating) edges joining nodes 1 and 1' (respectively, nodes n+2 and (n+2)') must be decorated with a  (respectively, ).  Furthermore, these are the only  (respectively, ) decorations that may occur on d and must be the first (respectively, last) decorations on their respective edges.


  *  Assume d has exactly one propagating edge e (which can only happen if n is odd). Then e may be decorated by an alternating sequence of  and  decorations.  If e is decorated by both open and closed decorations and is connected to node 1 (respectively, 1'), then the first (respectively, last) decoration occurring on e must be a .  Similarly, if e is connected to node n+2 (respectively, (n+2)'), then the first (respectively, last) decoration occurring on e must be a .  If e joins 1 to 1' (respectively, n+2 to (n+2)') and is decorated by a single decoration, then e is decorated by a single  (respectively, ).  Furthermore, if there is a non-propagating edge connected to 1 or 1' (respectively, n+2 or (n+2)') it must be decorated only by a single  (respectively, ).  Finally, no other  or  decorations appear on d.


  *  Assume that d is dammed with (d)>1 and has more than one propagating edge.  If there is a propagating edge joining 1 to 1' (respectively, n+2 to (n+2)'), then it is decorated by a single  (respectively, ).  Otherwise, both edges leaving either of 1 or 1' (respectively, n+2 or (n+2)') are each decorated by a single  (respectively, ) and there are no other  or  decorations appearing on d.

where the rectangle represents a sequence of blocks (possibly empty) such that each block is a single  and the diagram in (ii) can only occur if d is not decorated by any open decorations.  Also, the occurrences of the  decorations occurring on the propagating edge have the highest (respectively, lowest) relative vertical position of all decorations occurring on any propagating edge.  In particular, if the rectangle in (iv) (respectively, (v)) is empty, then the  decoration has the highest (respectively, lowest) relative vertical position among all decorations occurring on propagating edges.  We have an analogous requirement for the eastern end of e, where the closed decorations are replaced with open decorations.  Furthermore, if there is a non-propagating edge connected to 1 or 1' (respectively, n+2 or (n+2)') it must be decorated only by a single  (respectively, ).  Finally, no other  or  decorations appear on d.

$F$-related," 
Let $(D,C)$ be a Vogan superdiagram.
If $i \in C$ is an even vertex,
we define $F_i(D,C)$ as a new superdiagram $(D,C')$, where
all the vertices $j$ adjacent to $i$ have reversed their
circling (i.e. they become circled if they were not
and become not circled if they were circled), except
when $j$ is a longer root joint to $i$ by a double edge or $j$ is odd.
%(recall: odd roots are always non compact, hence we omit
%their circling).

In other words, if we define the neighborhood of
vertex $i$ by:
\beq\label{Fi}
N(i) = \{\hbox{vertices adjacent to}\, i \, \hbox{excluding} \, i\},

Then $F_i(D,C)=(D,C')$, where we reverse the circling of all
$j \in N(i)$, except when $j$ is a longer root joint to $i$

We also say that the Vogan superdiagram $(D,C')$ is obtained from
$(D,C)$ through the operation $F_i$. 
The reader can see that an operation $F_i$ can be visually
understood as ``pressing'' on the vertex $i$: the vertex itself
will not change the circling, while the adjacent vertices, if
linked by a single edge, will.

As explained in the introduction, a configuration of $N$ chips on the infinite path graph~$\mathbb{Z}$ corresponds to a vector $v=(v_1,\ldots,v_N)\in \Z^N$ where $v_i$ is the position of \chip i. We also want to sometimes consider vectors $v\in(\Z+\frac12)^N$, which we think of as configurations of $N$ labeled chips on the graph~$\Z+\frac12$ which is isomorphic to $\Z$ but has vertex labels shifted by $\frac12$. Given a configuration $v\in\Z^N$ or $v\in(\Z+\frac12)^N$, we define the following four types of \emph{moves}:
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item\label{move:A} for $i<j$, if chips~\chip i and \chip j are in the same position (i.e., $v_i=v_j$), move chip~\chip i one step to the right (i.e., increase $v_i$ by $1$) and chip~\chip j one step to the left (i.e., decrease $v_j$ by $1$);
  \item\label{move:B} for $i\in[N]$, if chip~\chip i is at the origin (i.e., $v_i=0$), move it one step to the right;
  \item\label{move:C} for $i\in[N]$, if chip~\chip i is at the origin (i.e., $v_i=0$), move it two steps to the right;

\textbf{(a)} Let $H$ be a $\mathbf{k}$-module, and let $G$ be an $A$-module.
For any $\mathbf{k}$-linear map $f:H\rightarrow G$, we let $f^{\sharp}$ denote
the $A$-linear map%
\[

(It is easy to see that this latter map is indeed well-defined and

we let $g^{\flat}$ denote the $\mathbf{k}$-linear map%
\[
H\rightarrow G,\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ h\mapsto g\left(  1\otimes h\right)  .
\]


Sometimes we will use the notations $f^{\sharp\left(  A,\mathbf{k}\right)  }$
and $g^{\flat\left(  A,\mathbf{k}\right)  }$ instead of $f^{\sharp}$ and
$g^{\flat}$ when the $A$ and the $\mathbf{k}$ are not clear from the context.

It is easy to see that $\left(  f^{\sharp}\right)  ^{\flat}=f$ for any
$\mathbf{k}$-linear map $f:H\rightarrow G$, and that $\left(  g^{\flat
}\right)  ^{\sharp}=g$ for any $A$-linear map $g:\underline{A}\otimes
H\rightarrow G$. Thus, the maps%
\begin{align}

This is a particular case of an adjunction between functors (namely, the

These sets partition $A_k$, so for all $t$, $A_k$ is the disjoint union of $X_k^t$, $A_k^t$ and $D_k^t$. To begin, we have $X_k^0=D_k^0=\emptyset$ and $A_k^0=A_k$. %, and in general the sets $X_k^t$ and $A_k^t$ % and $D_k^t$

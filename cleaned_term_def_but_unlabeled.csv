Colouring topology,"\label{color-top}  Let $Z$ be a sub-Cantor palette of order at most $k$.

Note that every colouring $\alpha = (\alpha_j)_{j=0}^\infty: Z \to A$ generates an element $\B_\alpha = (\B_{\alpha_j})_{j=0}^k$ of $\Col(Z)$, where $\B_{\alpha_j}$ is the $\sigma$-algebra of $Z_j$ is generated by the level sets of $\alpha_j: Z_j \to A_j$.

Projection of a witness tree,"For a witness tree $\tau$, we define the \emph{projection of $\tau$ onto permutation $\pi_k$} which we denote $\text{Proj}_k(\tau)$, as follows.

Suppose we have a node $v \in \tau$ which is labeled by some bad-event $B = (k_1, x_1, y_1), \dots, (k_r, x_r, y_r)$. For each $i$ with $k_i = k$, we create a corresponding node $v'_i \approx (x_i, y_i)$ in the graph $\text{Proj}_k(\tau)$. We also include some auxiliary information indicating that these nodes came from bad event $B$, and in particular that all such nodes are part of the same bad-event.

The edges of $\text{Proj}_k(\tau)$ are formed follows. For each node $v' \in \text{Proj}_k(\tau)$, labeled by $(x,y)$ and corresponding to $v \in \tau$, we find the node $w_x \in \tau$ (if any) which satisfies the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(P1)] The depth of $w_x$ is smaller than the depth of $v$
\item[(P2)] $w_x$ is labeled by some bad-event $B'$ which contains $(k,x, *)$
\item[(P3)] Among all vertices satisfying (P1), (P2), the depth of $w_x$ is maximial
\end{enumerate}

If this node $w_x \in \tau$ exists, then it corresponds to a node $w_x' \in \text{Proj}_k(\tau)$ labeled $(k, x, *)$; we construct an edge from $v'$ to $w_x'$. Note that, since the levels of the witness tree are independent under $\sim$, there can be at most one such $w_x$ and at most one such $w_x'$.

We similary define a node $w_y$ satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(P1')] The depth of $w_y$ is smaller than the depth of $v$
\item[(P2')] $w_y$ is labeled by some bad-event $B'$ which contains $(k,y, *)$
\item[(P3')] Among all vertices satisfying (P1), (P2), the depth of $w_y$ is maximial
\end{enumerate}
If this node exists, we create an edge from $v'$ to the corresponding $w_y' \in \text{Proj}_k(\tau)$ labeled $(k,*,y)$.

Note that since edges in $\text{Proj}_k(\tau)$ correspond to \emph{strictly} smaller depth in $\tau$, the graph $\text{Proj}_k (\tau)$ is acyclic. Also, note that it is possible that $w_x = w_y$; in this case we only add a single edge to $\text{Proj}_k(\tau)$.

\textbf{Expository Remark:} In the special case when each bad-event contains a single element, the witness subdag is a ``flattening"" of the tree structure. Each node in the tree corresponds to a node in the witness subdag, and each node in the witness subdag points to the next highest occurrence of the domain and range variables.",/home/shufan/que_tex/lllperm-journal3-arxiv.tex,definition[],"For a witness tree œÑ, we define the projection of œÑ onto permutation œÄ_k which we denote Proj_k(œÑ), as follows.

\rm Up-down Markov chains,"\label{2.3}
Let $\mathcal M$ be a Markov measure on $\mathcal T$ and $\{M^{(n)}\}$ be the
corresponding family of distributions on the sets $\Y_n$. To simplify the
discussion assume that $M^{(n)}(\la)>0$ for all $n$ and all $\la\in\Y_n$, so
that the transition probabilities $p^\up=\{p^\up(\la,\nu)\}$ and
$p^\down=\{p^\down(\la,\mu\}$ are well defined for all edges of the Young
graph.

For each $n=1,2,\dots$, we define a Markov chain with the state space $\Y_n$ in
the following way. Given a diagram $\la\in\Y_n$ we apply first the up
transition probabilities $p^\up(\la,\nu)$ and get a random diagram
$\nu\in\Y_{n+1}$. Then we come back to $\Y_n$ by using the down transition
probabilities $p^\down(\nu,\kappa)$. The composition $\la\to\nu\to\kappa$
constitutes a single step of the chain.

In other words, for two diagrams $\la,\kappa\in\Y_n$, the probability of the
one-step transition $\la\to\kappa$ is equal to
\begin{equation}\label{tag2.4}
\Prob\{\la\to\kappa\}=\sum_{\nu:\,
\la\nearrow\nu\searrow\kappa}p^\up(\la,\nu)p^\down(\nu,\kappa).

Admissible random walks and lattice paths,"Let $(S_{k})_{0\leq k \leq n}$ be a simple symmetric random walk on
  $\N_{0}$ or $\Z$ of length $n$ starting at $0$. That is, we have
  $\Prob(S_{0}=0) = 1$ as well as

%\ky{A graph theorist pointed out to me that it should either say ``if its intersection graph is weakly connected'' or ``if its intersection graph is connected as a graph'' because connectivity as a digraph is ambiguous between strongly connected and weakly connected (and even worse, strongly connected would probably be one's first guess).  Which do you prefer?}
%\jc{I just added ""weakly"" in brackets; it should be enough (I prefer not to insist too much on this point, but it's true it needed some corrections). Strong connectivity leads to nothing; our intersections graphs do not have any cycle.}
%\nz{The parenthetical looks fine to me; another alternative would be to explicitly distinguish the ``oriented intersection graph'' (as defined above) from the ``intersection graph'' (= underlying undirected graph of the oriented intersection graph), and then define connected diagrams in terms of the latter...but I guess that's just a less concise way of saying ``weakly connected'', and I don't think there are other places where we would want to refer to the unoriented intersection graph(?).
%(Julien: I'm not sure what you mean by ``leads to nothing'', but our interesection graphs are \emph{not} always strongly connected, in the sense that there might not always be a directed path between a pair of chords.)}

The \definand{intersection graph} of a chord diagram $C$ is defined as the digraph with a vertex for every chord, and an oriented edge from chord $(a,b)$ to chord $(c,d)$ whenever $a < c < b < d$.
A chord diagram is said to be \definand{connected} (or \emph{irreducible} ) if its intersection graph is (weakly) connected.
%\ky{A graph theorist pointed out to me that it should either say ``if its intersection graph is weakly connected'' or ``if its intersection graph is connected as a graph'' because connectivity as a digraph is ambiguous between strongly connected and weakly connected (and even worse, strongly connected would probably be one's first guess).  Which do you prefer?}
%\jc{I just added ""weakly"" in brackets; it should be enough (I prefer not to insist too much on this point, but it's true it needed some corrections). Strong connectivity leads to nothing; our intersections graphs do not have any cycle.}
%\nz{The parenthetical looks fine to me; another alternative would be to explicitly distinguish the ``oriented intersection graph'' (as defined above) from the ``intersection graph'' (= underlying undirected graph of the oriented intersection graph), and then define connected diagrams in terms of the latter...but I guess that's just a less concise way of saying ``weakly connected'', and I don't think there are other places where we would want to refer to the unoriented intersection graph(?).
%(Julien: I'm not sure what you mean by ``leads to nothing'', but our interesection graphs are \emph{not} always strongly connected, in the sense that there might not always be a directed path between a pair of chords.)}

We now identify this set of faces with the set of faces $\LL(C)$.

We can now associate an LRB structure to $\LL(S)$, as it is done for a set of faces of a pointed line; that is, to every face  $P \in \LL(S)$, we associate a vector of signs $i_H(P) \in (L^1_2)^k$ in the following way: Given $1 < j \leq k$, the  point $a_j$ divides  $S$ into three distinct parts: the point itself $\{x = a_j\}$ and two other open sets: $H_{j,1} = \{x > a_j\}$ and $H_{j,2} = \{x < a_j\}$.

We can now associate an LRB structure to (S), as it is done for a set of faces of a pointed line; that is, to every face  P ‚àà(S), we associate a vector of signs i_H(P) ‚àà (L^1_2)^k in the following way: Given 1 < j ‚â§ k, the  point a_j divides  S into three distinct parts: the point itself {x = a_j} and two other open sets: H_j,1 = {x > a_j} and H_j,2 = {x < a_j}.
Associate to the set H_j,1 the sign +, to the set H_j,2 the sign - and to the set {x = a_j} the sign 0. Obviously, as in the case of an unbounded component, one can rename the set H_j,1 as H_j,2 and H_j,2 as H_j,1 and thus induce a different assignment of signs, but once we assign these signs for each set, they are fixed.

For j=1, since we ignore the section {a_1' < x < a_1}, the  point a_1 divides  S into two distinct parts: the point {x = a_1} itself and  H_1,1 = {x > a_1}. Associate to the set H_1,1 the sign + (or -) and to the set {x = a_1} the sign 0. Again, once we associated these signs for each set, they are fixed  (see Figure <ref>(c)).

Thus, the map i_H:(S) ‚Üí (L^1_2)^k is defined as in Definition <ref>: for each face, the j^ th coordinate of i_H(P) for P ‚àà(S), depends on whether P = a_j, P ‚äÜ H_1,j or P ‚äÜ H_2,j."

edges on a finite linearly ordered vertex set
{v_0<v_1<‚ãØ<v_‚Ñì} such that


  * for each edge v_ie‚ü∂ v_j in Œì,
we have i<j; 

  * the weight w(e) of every edge e in Œì is a positive integer; 

  * the weight of an edge of the form v_i‚Üí v_i+1 must be ‚â•2
(‚Äúno short edges‚Äù); 

  * multiple edges are allowed, but loops are not;

  * for every j‚àà{1,‚Ä¶,‚Ñì-1}, there is at least one edge 
v_ie‚ü∂ v_k with i<j<k.
 
With a template¬†Œì, we associate several quantities. 
The number ‚Ñì=‚Ñì(Œì) is called the length of¬†Œì.
The product of squares of edge weights is the multiplicity
of¬†Œì, denoted by¬†Œº(Œì); cf.¬†(<ref>). 
The number

    Œ¥(Œì)
    =‚àë_v_i e‚ü∂  v_j
    ((j-i) w(e)-1)

is the cogenus of¬†Œì. 
(The terminology will be justified by
Lemma¬†<ref>.) 
We set 

    Œµ(Œì)=
    1    if all edges arriving at v_‚Ñì have weight¬†1;
    
    0    otherwise.

For j‚àà{1,‚Ä¶,‚Ñì}, 
let œ∞_j=œ∞_j(Œì) denote the total weight of all
edges v_ie‚ü∂ v_k with i<j‚â§ k. 
By definition of a template, we have œ∞_j>0. 
Let œ∞(Œì)=(œ∞_1,‚Ä¶,œ∞_‚Ñì).

    k_min(Œì)=max_1‚â§ j‚â§‚Ñì (œ∞_j-j+1).

"\emph{A bijection between labeled floor diagrams and
   labeled trees}","\label{def:diag-to-tree}
Suppose we have already defined such bijections for labeled floor
diagrams of genus~$0$ and any degree~$<d$.
Now, for a diagram $\Dcal$ of degree~$d$, do the following.
Decompose $\Dcal$ into the root vertex~$d$ and
subdiagrams~$\Dcal_1,\dots,\Dcal_k$ on vertex sets $S_1,\dots,S_k$, as
described in the proof of Theorem~\ref{th:cayley} above.
Let $T_1,\dots,T_k$ denote the trees on vertex sets $S_1,\dots,S_k$
that correspond to $\Dcal_1,\dots,\Dcal_k$, respectively,
under the appropriate bijections.
The tree~$T$ associated to~$\Dcal$ under the bijection in question is
constructed by connecting each tree $T_i$ to the root vertex~$d$ by a single
edge $e'$ that is going to be determined by the unique weighted edge
$v\stackrel{e}{\longrightarrow}d$
connecting $\Dcal_i$ to~$d$ in~$\Dcal$.
It remains to describe the rule that determines~$e'$ from~$e$.
We have already checked (see~\eqref{eq:1-div}) that the total number
of choices for~$e$ is equal to~$|S_i|$.
Let us record those choices in an ordered list as the vertex~$v$ moves left
to right within~$\Dcal_i$; for a given~$v$, we record the choices
starting with the \emph{largest} possible weight value $w(e)=1-\divv_i(v)$ and
decreasing it until we reach the smallest possible weight value
$w(e)=1$.
We similarly list the $|S_i|$ choices available for the
edge $v'\stackrel{e'}{\longrightarrow}d$ connecting $S_i$ to~$d$ ;
the ordering is determined by the (left-to-right) ordering of the
vertices $v'\in S_i$.

listed.",/home/shufan/que_tex/0906.3828.tex,definition[],"

The discrete cube and its faces,"\label{faces}
Let  $\2^k$ denote  the set $\{-1,1\}^k$, which we equip with the lexicographic order.  One can identify $\2^k$ with the vertices of the 
standard cube ${\bf I}^k := \{(x_1,\ldots,x_k) \in \R^k: -1 \leq x_i \leq 1\}$. Under this identification we will refer to $\2^k$ as the standard {\em discrete}
($k$-dimensional) cube. We will denote the elements of $\2^k$ by $\w=(w_1,\ldots,w_k)$.
For each $j=1,\ldots, k$, the sets $\beta_j^+ := \{\w \in \2^k: w_j=1\}$,  $\beta_j^- :=\{\w \in \2^k: w_j=-1\}$ correspond to the sets of vertices on opposite sides of the cube ${\bf I}^k$. We will  refer to $\beta_j^+, \beta_j^-$ as \emph{opposite sides} or \emph{parallel sides} of $\2^k$, and to the $\beta_j^+$ as the {\em positive sides}. 

More generally, for any $0 \leq l \leq k$, define an \emph{$l$-dimensional face} or \emph{$l$-face} to be any set formed by intersecting $k-l$ distinct non-parallel sides. Thus $\2^k$ has one $k$-face, $2k$ faces of dimension $k-1$ (i.e. the sides $\beta_j^{\pm}$), $k2^{k-l}$ faces of dimension $(k-l)$, and so forth down to $2^k$ faces of dimension $0$ (which are the vertices of the discrete cube).  

Let $\alpha$ be an $l$-face. Enumerating the elements of $\alpha$ in lexicographic order gives a natural bijection $\partial(\alpha): \alpha \to \2^l$, which we call the \emph{coordinate map} of $\alpha$, which maps the faces of $\2^k$, which are subsets of $\alpha$, to the faces of $\2^l$.",/home/shufan/que_tex/0901.2602.tex,definition[],"
Let  ^k denote  the set {-1,1}^k, which we equip with the lexicographic order.  One can identify ^k with the vertices of the 
standard cube I^k := {(x_1,‚Ä¶,x_k) ‚àà^k: -1 ‚â§ x_i ‚â§ 1}. Under this identification we will refer to ^k as the standard discrete

For $m\in[0,n]$ we say that $a$ has \emph{collected part} $a_1\cdots a_m$ if $a_1\prec\ldots\prec a_m$ and $a_m\prec a_i$ for $i>m$ but $a_{m+1}\succ a_j$ for some $j>m+1$. The string $a_{m+1}\cdots a_n$ is called the \emph{uncollected part} of $a$.

We define a \emph{collecting operator} $\mathcal{C}$ on the set of strings of commutators as follows. If $a$ is in collected form then we simply define $\mathcal{C}(a):=a$. If $a$ is not in collected form then write $\beta$ for the commutator earliest with respect to the order $\prec$ such that $\beta^{\pm1}$ appears in the uncollected part of $a$, and suppose that $a_j$ is the leftmost of the $a_i$ in the uncollected part that is equal to $\beta^{\pm1}$. Write $\alpha$ for the commutator satisfying $a_{j-1}=\alpha^{\pm1}$, and define $\alpha_1:=[\alpha,\beta]$ and $\alpha_{i+1}:=[\alpha_i,\beta]$ for $i=2,\ldots,s-1$. Define $\alpha_i$ to be trivial for $i\ge s$.

If $a_j=\beta$ and $a_{j-1}=\alpha$ then
\[
\mathcal{C}(a):=a_1\cdots a_{j-2}\beta\alpha[\alpha,\beta]a_{j+1}\cdots a_n,
\]
and we say that $\mathcal{C}$ performs a \emph{transformation of type 1} on $a$. If $a_j=\beta$ and $a_{j-1}=\alpha^{-1}$ then
\[
\mathcal{C}(a):=a_1\cdots a_{j-2}\beta[\alpha,\beta]^{-1}\alpha^{-1}a_{j+1}\cdots a_n,
\]
and we say that $\mathcal{C}$ performs a \emph{transformation of type 2} on $a$. If $a_j=\beta^{-1}$ and $a_{j-1}=\alpha$ then
\[
\mathcal{C}(a):=a_1\cdots a_{j-2}\beta^{-1}\alpha\alpha_2\alpha_4\cdots\alpha_5^{-1}\alpha_3^{-1}\alpha_1^{-1}a_{j+1}\cdots a_n,
\]
and we say that $\mathcal{C}$ performs a \emph{transformation of type 3} on $a$. If $a_j=\beta^{-1}$ and $a_{j-1}=\alpha^{-1}$ then
\[
\mathcal{C}(a):=a_1\cdots a_{j-2}\beta^{-1}\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_5\cdots\alpha_4^{-1}\alpha_2^{-1}\alpha^{-1}a_{j+1}\cdots a_n,
\]
and we say that $\mathcal{C}$ performs a \emph{transformation of type 4} on $a$. The collecting process is then the sequence $a,\mathcal{C}(a),\mathcal{C}^2(a),\ldots$.

Finally, we will often talk about the set of \emph{copies} of a commutator in the collecting process. Each $a_i$ in the original string $a$ is said to be a copy of the commutator $\gamma$ if $a_i=\gamma$, or a copy of $\gamma^{-1}$ if $a_i=\gamma^{-1}$. The collecting operator $\mathcal{C}$ is then thought of as permuting the existing copies of the commutators and of creating a new copy of $[\alpha,\beta]$ in the case of a transformation of type 1; a new copy of $[\alpha,\beta]^{-1}$ in the case of a transformation of type 2; new copies of $\alpha_2,\alpha_4\ldots$ and $\alpha_1^{-1}\alpha_3^{-1}\ldots$ in the case of a transformation of type 3; and new copies of $\alpha_1,\alpha_3\ldots$ and $\alpha_2^{-1}\alpha_4^{-1}\ldots$ in the case of a transformation of type 4.",/home/shufan/que_tex/1211.3989.tex,definition[],"hall]

We refer to $m$ as the \emph{dimension} of the factor, $D_1,\ldots,D_m$ as the \emph{initial degrees} , and $J_1,\ldots,J_m$ as the \emph{depths} .  The \emph{degree} of the factor is the quantity $\sup_{1 \leq i \leq m} D_i + J_i(p-1)$.

A \emph{depth extension} of $P$ is a factor of the form $P' = (P_{i,j})_{1 \leq i \leq m; 0 \leq j \leq J'_i}$, where $J'_i \geq J_i$ for each $1 \leq i \leq m$, and the polynomials $P_{i,j}$ in $P'$ agree with their counterparts in $P$ for $j \leq J_i$.
If $P'$ is a depth extension of $P$, we call $P$ a \emph{depth retraction} of $P'$.  If $d$ is a standard integer, we define the \emph{degree $\leq d$ depth retraction} $P_{\leq d}$ of $P$ to be the retraction formed by deleting all $P_{i,j}$ with $D_i + J_i(p-1) > d$.

A function $Q: V \to \ultra \T$ is said to be \emph{measurable} with respect to the factor $P$ if one has $Q = F( P_{1,J_1},\ldots,P_{m,J_m} )$ for some function $F: \ultra \T^m \to \ultra \T$.",/home/shufan/que_tex/1101.1469.tex,definition[],"Let V be a limit finite-dimensional vector space.

Nilsequences,"A \emph{$2$-step nilmanifold} is a homogeneous space $G/\Gamma$, where $G$ is a nilpotent Lie groups of step at most $2$, and $\Gamma$ is a discrete cocompact subgroup.  A \emph{fundamental $2$-step nilmanifold} is one of the following three examples of a $2$-step nilmanifold:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textup{(Unit circle)} $G = \R$ and $\Gamma = \Z$.
\item \textup{(Skew torus)} $G = \left(\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & \Z & \R \\ 0 & 1 & \R \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ and $\Gamma = \left(\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & \Z & \Z \\ 0 & 1 & \Z \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$.

We place smooth metrics on each of these nilmanifolds; the exact choice of metric is not important.

	%We start with a uniformly randomly chosen generalised spider $R_0$ with length vector $(\ell_1-\gamma_{1,0},\dots,\ell_s-\gamma_{s,0})$. If $R_0$ is $(\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s,\alpha_0)$-weak for $\alpha_0=\frac{1}{L^2}$, then we terminate the process. Otherwise, we extend $R_0$ uniformly randomly to an $L$-bad spider $S_1$ with length vector $(\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s)$. We then take a uniformly random $L$-bad spider among those with length vector $(\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s)$ and the same leaf vector as $S_1$. We call this spider $T_1$. Then we set $R_1$ to be the subspider of $T_1$ with length vector $(\ell_1-\gamma_{1,1},\dots,\ell_s-\gamma_{s,1})$. More generally, for any $1\leq j\leq k$, given a generalised spider $R_{j-1}$ with length vector $(\ell_1-\gamma_{1,j-1},\dots,\ell_s-\gamma_{s,j-1})$, we terminate the process if $R_{j-1}$ is $(\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s,\alpha_{j-1})$-weak for $\alpha_{j-1}=\frac{1}{L^{2^{j}}}$.

Varieties,"A \emph{projective algebraic set} (resp. \emph{affine algebraic set} ) is a subset $V$ of a projective space $\P^N$ (resp. affine space $\A^N$) of the form
$$ V = \{ x \in \P^N: P_1(x) = \ldots = P_J(x) = 0 \}$$
where $P_1,\ldots,P_J$ are homogeneous polynomials (resp. polynomials).  A projective (resp. affine) algebraic set is called \emph{irreducible} if it cannot be written as the union of two proper projective (resp. affine) algebraic subsets, in which case we refer to the algebraic set as a \emph{variety} .

The \emph{dimension} of an algebraic set $V$ is the smallest integer $d$ such that intersections of $V$ with generic codimension-$d$ subspaces of $\P^N$ or $\A^N$ are finite.  If $V$ is a projective variety of dimension $d$, then generic codimension $d$ subspaces of $\P^N$ intersect $V$ in a constant number of points, known as the \emph{degree} of $V$.  Every affine variety can be embedded in a unique projective variety of the same dimension (the projective \emph{closure} of the affine variety); we define the degree of the affine variety to be that of its projective closure.

\begin{remark}  The definitions given here are classical in style, and thus subject to certain pathologies; for instance, one might expect the vanishing locus of a degree-$d$ polynomial in $2$ variables to be a curve of degree $d$, and this is generically the case: but if the polynomial is, for instance, $(x+y)^d$, then the vanishing locus is (according to our definition) a curve of degree $1$.  Problems of this kind will change degrees at worst by bounded multiplicative constants, so we will systematically ignore them; in any event, all proofs in the paper work when the better-behaved scheme-theoretic definitions of dimension and degree are used.

cutting an embedding along a dual cycle,"Let $G$ be a graph embedded in a surface $\Sigma$

such that $\gamma$ is two-sided and $\Sigma$-nonseparating. Now cut
the surface along $\gamma$, discarding the set $E'$ of edges of $G$ that are
severed in the process. This yields an embedding of $G-E$ in a surface
with two holes. Then paste two discs, one along the boundary of each
hole, to get back to a compact surface. We denote the resulting
embedding by $G\cutt\gamma$, and say that this is obtained by {\em

$G\cutt\gamma$ as the embedded $(G^*\cutt\gamma)^*$.

Dynamic integer flow,"\label{def:dynflows}
Given a signed graph $G$ and an edge $e=(i,j,+)$ of $G$, we will regard $e=(i,j,+)$ as two positive {\em half-edges} $(i,\varnothing,+)$ and $(\varnothing,j,+)$ that still have ``memory'' of being together (see Figure \ref{fig:dynflow} (a)). We assign nonnegative {\em integer} flows $b_{\ell}(e)$ and $b_{r}(e)$ to the left and right halves of the positive edge, starting at the left half-edge. Once we assign $b_{\ell}(e)$ units of flow, {\em we add $b_{\ell}(e)$ {\bf extra right positive half-edges}}  {\em incident to $j$}. Any right positive half-edge $e'$ is assigned a nonnegative integer flow $b_r(e')$ (whether it was an extra right positive half-edge, or an original one). When we assign a nonnegative integer flow to a right positive half-edge no edges of any kind are added making the process of adding extra edges to the graph finite.

Flag affine $\Delta$-set,"An {\it affine $\Delta$-set} is an affine simplicial complex $\mathcal K$ where
every simplex is endowed with a total ordering of vertices so that every
inclusion between simplices of $\mathcal K$ is monotone on the sets of vertices.
(See \cite{Fr}, \cite{RS2} concerning general $\Delta$-sets.)

Since the total orderings of vertex sets of simplices agree, they extend
to a partial order on the set of all vertices of $\mathcal K$.
Thus an affine $\Delta$-set is simply an affine simplicial complex endowed
with a partial ordering of vertices such that every two vertices connected

If P is a poset, Q and Q coincide with the smallest
closed subposet and the smallest open subposet containing Q.

The collection of all open subposets of a poset Q=(ùí¨,‚â§) determines
a topology on ùí¨, known as the Alexandroff or the right order topology.
It goes back to P. S. Alexandroff <cit.> that the following are equivalent
for a T_0 topological space X:

(i) Arbitrary intersections of open sets are open in X;

(ii) Every point has a smallest neighborhood in X;

(iii) X is homeomorphic to a poset endowed with the Alexandroff topology."

\item $f(\cel p\cer)\subset\cel f(p)\cer$ for each $p\in P$.

lies in every open subposet of $P$ containing $p$; whereas if $f(p)\nless f(p')$,
then $f(p')$ does not lie in the open subposet $\cel f(p)\cer$ of $Q$.

Definitions for Parity Proof Framework,"We proceed with further definitions.  Suppose we have a label set that can be partitioned into pairs of \emph{opposite} labels.  We say such a label set is \emph{strictly symmetric} .  Define a \emph{labelling} $\ell$ to be an unordered, unoriented way of labelling a simplex, i.e.\ a multi-set of labels.  There is a natural notion of an \emph{opposite labelling} $-\ell$, where we take the opposite of each label in the multi-set.  We use \emph{$i$-labelling} to refer to the labelling of an $i$-simplex, i.e.\ a multi-set of $i+1$ labels.  Let $L^i$ denote the set of $i$-labellings.  Note that $L^i$ may not be strictly symmetric even though the label set is strictly symmetric, e.g.\ labelling $\{+e_1,-e_1\}$ is its own opposite.

Now we define the set of \emph{forbidden labellings} $F\subseteq\bigcup_{i=0}^n L^i$.  (Assume $F\cap L^0=\emptyset$; otherwise we would just make the label set smaller.)  In the case of Tucker's lemma, $F$ is the set of labellings with a complementary edge.  In the case of Theorem~\ref{thtucub}, $F$ is the set of labellings with a neutral simplex.  The idea is to choose $F$'s such that $L^i\backslash F$ is strictly symmetric for all $0\le i\le n$.  That is, $F$ must be symmetric and contain all the labellings which are their own opposite.

If $M^i$ is a strictly symmetric subset of $i$-labellings, then from each pair of opposite labellings, we can choose one to be the `+' labelling and the other to be the `-' labelling.

The \textit{tropical real double Hurwitz number (with real structures)} $\tilde{H}_{g}^{\trop}(\mu,\nu)$ is defined as the weighted number $\tilde{H}_{g}^{\trop}(\mu,\nu)=\sum_{\pi} \tilde{m}(\pi)$ of tropical degree $d$ real covers $\pi: C \rightarrow L$ where
\begin{itemize}
 \item $C$ is an abstract tropical curve of genus $g$;
\item the tuple of weights of ends adjacent to leaves mapping to $-\infty$ is $\mu$, the tuple of weights of ends adjacent to leaves mapping to $\infty$ is $\nu$;
%\item the leaves are marked (to make those of the same weights distinguishable);
\item the preimage $\pi^{-1}(p_i)$ contains a vertex of $C$.
\end{itemize}
It follows from the Euler characteristic of $C$ together with the Riemann-Hurwitz formula that $C$ has only $3$-valent inner vertices, and that there are $r>0$ such vertices.

We now define the multiplicity $\tilde{m}(\pi)$ with which a real tropical cover $\pi:C\rightarrow L$ contributes to $\tilde{H}_{g}^{\trop}(\mu,\nu)$.

Two vertices are adjacent if and only if they differ in exactly one coordinate position,

The Hamming distance d(xÃÖ,yÃÖ) between vertices xÃÖ and yÃÖ

orthogonal arrays and related concepts,"An \emph{orthogonal array} OA$(N,n,q,t)$ is a multiset $C$
of vertices of $H(n,q)$ of cardinality $N$ such that every 
subgraph isomorphic to $H(n-t,q)$ contains exactly
$N/q^{t}$ elements of $C$.
An {orthogonal array} is \emph{simple} if it is a usual set; that is,
if it does not contain elements of multiplicity more than $1$.
% A (Boolean) function $\{0,1\}^n\to \{0,1\}$ is called \emph{$t$-th order correlation immune} 
% if the set of vectors with function value $1$ is an OA$(N,n,2,t)$ 
% (so, the $t$-th order correlation immune functions are in one-to-one correspondence 
% with the simple binary (i.e., $q=2$) orthogonal arrays of strength $t$).
Two orthogonal arrays are \emph{equivalent} if some automorphism of $H(n,q)$
induces a bijection between their elements.
The \emph{automorphism group} $\mathrm{Aut}(C)$ of an orthogonal array $C$
(as well as any other set $C$ of vertices of $H(n,q)$)
consists of all automorphisms of $H(n,q)$ that stabilize $C$ set-wise.
The \emph{orbit} of a vertex $\bar v$ under the action of  $\mathrm{Aut}(C)$ is the 
set of images $A(\bar v)$ over all $A$ from $\mathrm{Aut}(C)$.
The \emph{kernel} of $C\subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ is the set $\{\bar k\in \{0,1\}^n \,:\, \bar k+C=C\}$

$\{0, 1,\ldots,q-1\}^n \backslash C$. Obviously, the complement
of a simple  OA$(N,n,q,t)$ is a simple OA$(q^n-N,n,q,t)$.

The Bijection for $\SOodd$,"We start with a pair $(Q,L)$ consisting of a standard Young tableau $Q$ in $\SYT(\lambda)$ and an orthogonal Littlewood-Richardson tableau $L$ in $\LRtabs$.

First we use Bijection $A$ (see Section~\ref{sec:BijA}) to change $L$ into an alternative orthogonal Littlewood-Richardson tableau $\tilde{L}$. Now we use $\tilde{L}$ to obtain a larger standard Young tableau $\tilde{Q}$ with row lengths of the same parity as follows. If $e$ is the largest entry in $Q$ we add a cells labeled $e+(\mu_{j+1}+\dots+\mu_{\ell(\mu)})+1$, $e+(\mu_{j+1}+\dots+\mu_{\ell(\mu)})+2$,  $\dots$, $e+(\mu_{j+1}+\dots+\mu_{\ell(\mu)})+\mu_j$ to the spots where cells labeled $j$ are in $\tilde{L}$, such that the numbers in the horizontal strip belonging to $j$ are increasing from left to right. We obtain a new standard Young tableau $\tilde{Q}$ with the same shape as $L$. Moreover the $\mu$ largest entries form a $\mu$-horizontal strip (see Section~\ref{sec:BijB}).

Now we distinguish two cases: If our resulting tableau $\tilde{Q}$ consists of even length rows this is the tableau we will use in Bijection $B$ (see Section~\ref{sec:BijB}). Otherwise, thus when $\tilde{Q}$ consists of $n$ odd length rows, we concatenate the one column tableau filled with $1,2,\dots,n$ from left to $\tilde{Q}$. We obtain an all even rowed standard Young tableau, which we will use in in Bijection $B$.

We continue applying Bijection $B$ to $\tilde{Q}$ and obtain a vacillating tableau $\tilde{V}$ with shape $\emptyset$ and cut-away-shape $\mu$ (shape $\emptyset$ ending with $\mu_{\ell(\mu)}$ $(-\ell(\mu))$'s, $\dots$, $\mu_2$ $(-2)$'s and $\mu_1$ $(-1)$'s, see Section~\ref{sec:BijB}).

Once again we distinguish the two cases from before. If we did not concatenate with a column, we do not change $\tilde{V}$. If we concatenated a column to $\tilde{Q}$, we delete the first $n$ entries of $\tilde{V}$. In this case those always are $1,2,\dots,k,0,-k,\dots,-2,-1$. 
Therefore we obtain once again a vacillating tableau $\tilde{V}$ with shape $\emptyset$ and cut-away-shape $\mu$.

We finish our algorithm by deleting the last $|\mu|=\mu_1+\mu_2+\dots+\mu_k$ entries to obtain a vacillating tableau $V$ of shape $\mu$ and length $r=|\lambda|$.",/home/shufan/que_tex/1902.03843.tex,definition[],"We start with a pair (Q,L) consisting of a standard Young tableau Q in (Œª) and an orthogonal Littlewood-Richardson tableau L in .

We have either $\mathcal{E}_i-1=\mathcal{C}_i$ or
$\mathcal{E}_i-2=\mathcal{C}_i$: in the first case, the edge dual to $\tau_i$ in the tropical curve leads to a fixed component, in the second to a free component (see definition \ref{definition:fixed_free_components}). Every vertex of the dual tropical curve has exactly two fixed components, we use the indices $i_0$ and $i_1$ for those labels corresponding to edges in the dual tropical curve that lead to a fixed component.

Moreover, $C_\mathcal{S}$ passes through the points $p_1,\dots,p_n$ by construction \ref{construction:dual_tropical_curve}.

Convention on basepoints,"\label{def:subdn basepoints}
Suppose $Y\subseteq \Z^n$ is a based digital image with basepoint $y_0 = (y_1, \ldots, y_n)$.  In any subdivision $S(Y, k)$ of $Y$ we may take $\overline{y_0} \in  S(y_0, k)\subseteq S(Y, k)$ as the basepoint, where $\overline{y_0}$ denotes the point whose coordinates are
%
$$\overline{y_0}= \begin{cases} (2ky_1 + k-1, \ldots, 2ky_n + k-1) & \text{ in } S(Y, 2k)\\ \big( (2k+1)y_1 + k, \ldots, (2k+1)y_n + k\big) & \text{ in } S(Y, 2k+1).\end{cases}$$
%
In an odd subdivision, $\overline{y_0}$ is the centre point of $S(y_0, 2k+1)$, which is a cubical  lattice in $\Z^n$, each side of which contains $2k+1$ points.  In an even subdivision, $S(y_0, 2k)$ does not have a centre point, as such, since there is no middle point in an interval which contains $2k$ points.  Rather, $\overline{y_0}$ is a corner of the \emph{central clique} of  $S(y_0, 2k)$, which is to say a unit cubical  lattice in $\Z^n$ that may be considered as the center of $S(y_0, 2k)$.  Usually, and unless there is some reason not to do so, we will choose  $\overline{y_0}$ as the basepoint of a subdivision $S(Y, k)$.   One exception to this is  our convention that $0 \in I_N$ is the basepoint of an interval. This means that when we  subdivide an interval, the basepoint of $S(I_N, k) = I_{Nk+k-1}$ will be $0$ rather than $\overline{0} = k$.   However we choose the basepoint in a subdivision, so long as we have the basepoint of $S(Y, k)$ to be some point in $S(y_0, k) \subseteq S(Y, k)$, then the standard projection $\rho_k \colon S(Y, k) \to Y$ is a based map.  In particular, note  that we have $\rho_k(\overline{y_0}) = y_0$.   Furthermore, with our convention that $\overline{y_0}$ is the basepoint of $S(Y, k)$, the partial projections $\rho^c_k\colon S(Y, k) \to S(Y, k-1)$ for each $k \geq 3$ of \defref{def: rho^c} are also based maps.  Indeed, from the formulas of \defref{def: rho^c}, for

Nonstandard concepts,"\label{nonst}  Let $G$ be a nonstandard additive group, and let $A, B$ be nonstandard finite subsets of $G$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] We say that $A$ is \emph{small} if its cardinality $|A|$ is a standard natural number, and \emph{large} otherwise.  (Note that $A$ is small if and only if it is (externally) finite.)  We say that $A,B$ have \emph{comparable size} if $|A| \ll |B| \ll |A|$.
\item[(ii)]  We say that $A$ is \emph{somewhat sum-closed} if $\phi(A)$ is (standardly) finite. 
\item[(iii)] We write
$$ A+B := \{ a+b: a \in A, b \in B \}$$ 
for the Minkowski sum of $A$ and $B$, and say that $A$ has \emph{bounded doubling} if $|A+A| \ll |A|$.  For instance, any coset $x+H$ of a nonstandard finite group $H$ is of bounded doubling.
\item[(iv)] For any standard natural number $l$, we write $lA = A + \dots + A$ for the $l$-fold iterated sumset of $A$.  (
Although it can be done, we will not need to define $lA$ for unbounded $l$.)
\item[(v)] We say that $A$ \emph{avoids} $B$ if $|A \cap B| = o(|B|)$, and \emph{occupies} $B$ if it does not avoid $B$ (or equivalently, if $|A \cap B| \gg |B|$).  For instance, if $A$ and $B$ are groups, $A$ avoids $B$ when $A \cap B$ has (externally) infinite index in $B$, and $A$ occupies $B$ when $A \cap B$ has (externally) finite index in $B$.  See also Figure \ref{fig:com}.
\item[(vi)]  We say that $A$ and $B$ are \emph{commensurate} if they occupy each other, and \emph{transverse} if they avoid each other.  
\item[(vii)] A sequence $A_n$ of sets indexed by standard natural numbers $n$ is said to be an \emph{wandering sequence} if for every standard natural numbers $n,m$, we have $(A_n+A_m) \cap (A_n+A_{m'}) = \emptyset$ for all but finitely many $m'$.  For instance, if $x_n+H$ is a sequence of disjoint cosets of a single nonstandard finite group $H$, then the $x_n+H$ form an wandering sequence.
\item[(viii)] We say that $A$ has the \emph{wandering property} if the sequence $nA$ is an wandering sequence, or equivalently that $nA \cap n'A = \emptyset$ whenever $n'$ is sufficiently large depending on $n$.  For example, a coset $x+H$ of a nonstandard finite group $H$ has the wandering property if and only if $x$ has infinite order in $G/H$, or equivalently if $nx \not \in H$ for any standard $n$.  As another example, if $G = {}^* \Z$ are the nonstandard integers and $N$ is an unbounded natural number, then the nonstandard interval $\{ n \in {}^* \Z: N \leq n < 2N \}$ has the wandering property, but the nonstandard interval $\{ n \in {}^* \Z: 1 \leq n \leq N\}$ does not.

Algebraic varieties,"Let $n$ be a natural number, and let $k$ be an algebraically closed field.  An \emph{affine variety} (or more precisely, an \emph{algebraic set} ) in $k^n$ over $k$ is a set $V$ of the form
\begin{equation}\label{vdef}
V =\{ x \in k^n\mid P_1(x) = \ldots = P_m(x) = 0 \}
\end{equation}
for some polynomials $P_1,\ldots,P_m: k^n \to k$.    Similarly, we define the \emph{projective space} $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ to be the space of equivalence classes $[x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}]$ of tuples $(x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}) \in k^{n+1} \backslash \{0\}$ after quotienting out by dilations by $k$, and define a \emph{projective variety} in $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ to be a set $V$ of the form
\begin{equation}\label{vdef-2}
V =\{ x \in \mathbb{P}^n(k)\mid P_1(x) = \ldots = P_m(x) = 0 \}
\end{equation}
for some homogeneous polynomials $P_1,\ldots,P_m: k^{n+1} \to k$ (note that the constraint $P_1(x)=\ldots=P_m(x)=0$ is well-defined in $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$).   We embed $k^n$ in $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ in the usual manner, identifying $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ with $[x_1,\ldots,x_n,1]$; thus for instance every affine variety can be viewed as a subset of an associated projective variety.  

A subset of $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ is said to be a \emph{quasiprojective variety} if it is the set-theoretic difference of two projective varieties in $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$.  Thus for instance the set-theoretic difference of two affine varieties in $k^n$ is a quasiprojective variety.  
A \emph{constructible set} in $k^n$ is a boolean combination of finitely many affine varieties in $k^n$.  As noted in Section \ref{algreg-sec}, constructible sets are definable over $k$ (indeed, as $k$ is algebraically closed, the two concepts coincide in this setting), and so we can inherit the notion of complexity for such sets.  

We define the \emph{Zariski topology} on $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ by declaring the projective varieties to be the closed sets; thus, for instance, the \emph{Zariski closure} $\overline{E}$ of a subset $E$ of $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ is the intersection of all the projective varieties which contain that set.  One can then induce the Zariski topologies on other varieties by restriction.  For instance, in the affine space $k^n$, the Zariski closed sets are given by the affine varieties.

An affine (resp. projective) variety is \emph{geometrically irreducible} , or \emph{irreducible} for short, if it is non-empty and cannot be expressed as the union of two strictly smaller affine (resp. projective) varieties.  We say that a quasiprojective variety (or more generally, a constructible set) is irreducible if its Zariski closure is irreducible.  It is well known (see e.g. \cite[Propositions I.5.2, I.5.3]{mumf}) that any affine (resp. projective) variety can be uniquely decomposed into finitely many irreducible subvarieties, no two of which are contained in each other.  

The \emph{dimension} $\dim(V)$ of a non-empty affine (resp. projective) variety $V$ is the largest natural number $d$ for which there is a chain 
$$ \emptyset \neq V_0 \subsetneq V_1 \subsetneq \ldots \subsetneq V_d \subset V$$
of irreducible affine (resp. projective)  varieties $V_0, \ldots, V_d$; this is always a finite natural number.  We adopt the convention that the empty set has dimension $-\infty$.  The dimension of a quasiprojective variety (in $k^n$ or $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$) is defined to be the dimension of its Zariski closure in the indicated ambient space.  A variety will be called a \emph{curve} if it has dimension one.

If $V,W$ are two varieties with $V \subseteq W$, we say that $V$ is a \emph{subvariety} of $W$.  If $V \subsetneq W$, we say that $V$ is a \emph{strict subvariety} of $W$.

Let $\F$ be a subfield of $k$.  We say that an affine (resp. projective) variety is \emph{defined over $\F$} if one can find polynomials $P_1,\ldots,P_m$ with coefficients in $\F$ for which \eqref{vdef} (resp. \eqref{vdef-2}) holds.  A quasiprojective variety is defined over $\F$ if it is the set-theoretic difference of two affine varieties defined over $\F$.  If $V \subset k^n$ is a quasiprojective variety, we define $V(\F) := V \cap \F^n$ to be the $F$-points of $V$; note that this is a definable subset over $\F$.

Let $V$ be a quasiprojective variety.  If $V \subset k^n$, a \emph{regular function} on $V$ is a function $f: V \to k$ which, at every point $p$ in $V$, agrees with a rational function from (an open dense subset of) $k^n$ to $k$ on an open neighbourhood of $p$ in $V$.  If instead $V \subset \mathbb{P}^n(k)$, a regular function on $V$ is a function which is regular when restricted to the $n+1$ affine subsets $\{ [x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}] \in \mathbb{P}^n(k)\mid x_i \neq 0 \}$, $i=1,\ldots,n+1$ that cover ${\mathbb P}^n(k)$, each of which can be identified with the affine space $k^n$ in the obvious manner.  The ring of regular functions on $V$ is denoted $k[V]$, and its fraction field (which is well defined for irreducible $V$) is denoted $k(V)$.  A map $\phi: V \to W$ between two quasiprojective varieties is a \emph{regular morphism} if every regular function on $W$ pulls back by $\phi$ to a regular function on $V$.  A \emph{regular isomorphism} is an invertible regular morphism whose inverse is also regular.",/home/shufan/que_tex/1211.2894.tex,definition[],"Let n be a natural number, and let k be an algebraically closed field.

Nonstandard objects and functions,"Given a sequence $(x_\n)_{\n \in \N}$ of standard objects in ${\mathfrak U}$, we define their \emph{ultralimit} $\lim_{\n \to \alpha} x_\n$ to be the equivalence class of all sequences $(y_\n)_{\n \in \N}$ of standard objects in ${\mathfrak U}$ such that $x_\n = y_\n$ for $\n$ sufficiently close to $\alpha$.

Ultraproducts,"Let $(X_\n)_{\n \in \N}$ be a sequence of standard spaces $X_\n$ in ${\mathfrak U}$ indexed by the natural numbers.  The \emph{ultraproduct} $\prod_{\n \to \alpha} X_\n$ of the $X_\n$ is defined to be the space of all ultralimits $\lim_{\n \to \alpha} x_\n$, where $x_\n \in X_\n$ for all $\n$.  We refer to the ultraproduct of standard sets as an \emph{nonstandard set} ; in a similar vein, an ultraproduct of standard finite sets is a \emph{nonstandard finite set} , and an ultraproduct of standard finite fields is a \emph{nonstandard finite field} .  We refer to $\ultra X := \prod_{\n \to \alpha} X$ as the \emph{ultrapower} of a standard set $X$; the identification of $x$ with $\lim_{\n \to \alpha} x$ causes $X$ to be identified with a subset of $\ultra X$.  We will refer to the ultrapower  $\ultra {\mathfrak U}$ of the standard universe ${\mathfrak U}$ as the \emph{nonstandard universe} .

In a similar spirit, if $f_\n: X_\n \to Y_\n$ is a collection of standard functions between standard sets $X_\n,Y_\n$, we can form the \emph{ultralimit} $f := \lim_{\n \to \alpha} f_\n$ to be the function from $X := \prod_{\n \to \alpha} X_\n$ to $Y := \prod_{\n \to \alpha} Y_\n$ defined by the formula

We refer to such functions as \emph{nonstandard functions} (also known as \emph{internal functions} in the nonstandard analysis literature).

As with nonstandard objects, any operation or relation on standard spaces can be converted to a nonstandard analogue in the usual manner.  For instance, the nonstandard cardinality of a nonstandard finite set $X = \prod_{\n \to \alpha} X_\n$ is the nonstandard natural number
$$ |X| := \lim_{\n \to \alpha} |X_\n|.$$
Note that this is a different concept from the usual (or \emph{external} ) cardinality of $X$; indeed, nonstandard finite sets usually have an uncountable external cardinality.  Similarly, if $f: X \to \ultra \R$ is a nonstandard function $f = \lim_{\n \to \alpha} f_\n$ defined on a nonstandard finite set $X = \prod_{\n \to \alpha} X_\n$, we can define the nonstandard sum $\sum_{x \in X} f(x)$ to be the nonstandard real number

Note that this is a different concept from the usual (or external ) cardinality of X; indeed, nonstandard finite sets usually have an uncountable external cardinality.  Similarly, if f: X ‚Üí is a nonstandard function f = lim_‚ÜíŒ± f_ defined on a nonstandard finite set X = ‚àè_‚ÜíŒ± X_, we can define the nonstandard sum ‚àë_x ‚àà X f(x) to be the nonstandard real number

",Ultraproducts,"Let (X_)_‚àà be a sequence of standard spaces X_ in ùîò indexed by the natural numbers.  The ultraproduct ‚àè_‚ÜíŒ± X_ of the X_ is defined to be the space of all ultralimits lim_‚ÜíŒ± x_, where x_‚àà X_ for all .  We refer to the ultraproduct of standard sets as an nonstandard set ; in a similar vein, an ultraproduct of standard finite sets is a nonstandard finite set , and an ultraproduct of standard finite fields is a nonstandard finite field .  We refer to X := ‚àè_‚ÜíŒ± X as the ultrapower of a standard set X; the identification of x with lim_‚ÜíŒ± x causes X to be identified with a subset of X.  We will refer to the ultrapower  ùîò of the standard universe ùîò as the nonstandard universe .

In a similar spirit, if f_: X_‚Üí Y_ is a collection of standard functions between standard sets X_,Y_, we can form the ultralimit f := lim_‚ÜíŒ± f_ to be the function from X := ‚àè_‚ÜíŒ± X_ to Y := ‚àè_‚ÜíŒ± Y_ defined by the formula

    f( lim_‚ÜíŒ± x_n ) := lim_‚ÜíŒ± f_(x_).

We refer to such functions as nonstandard functions (also known as internal functions in the nonstandard analysis literature).

%Let $G$ be a hypergraph with vertices $V=\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ and edges
%$E$, and let $s$ be a positive integer. We create a new hypergraph
%$G^s$, called \emph{the $s^{\text{th}}$ expansion of $G$}. We form the vertex set of $G^s$ by replacing each $x_i$ with vertices $x_{i,1}, \dots$, $x_{i,s}$, and we call each of these vertices \emph{shadows} of $x_i$. In analogy with the algebraic process of polarization, we call setting each $x_{i,t}$ equal to $x_i$ \emph{depolarization} . The edge set of $G^s$ consists of two types of edges. First, we connect each pair of shadows of the same variable, so we have edges $x_{i,j}x_{i,\ell}$ for all $1 \le j < \ell \le s$. Second, for each edge $x_{i_{1}}\cdots x_{i_{r}}$ of $G$, we have $s^r$ edges $x_{i_1,j_1}\cdots x_{i_r,j_r}$ of $G^s$, where $1 \le j_t \le s$ for each $t$.

Horizontal Taylor coefficients,"\label{horton}  Let $G = (G, (G_{(d,r)})_{(d,r) \in \DR})$ be a degree-rank-filtered nilpotent group.  For every $i \geq 0$, define the \emph{$i^{\th}$ horizontal space} $\Horiz_i(G)$ to be the abelian group 
$$ \Horiz_i(G) := G_{(i,1)} / G_{(i,2)},$$
with the convention that $G_{(d,r)} := G_{(d+1,0)}$ if $r>d$ (so in particular, $G_{(1,2)} = G_{(2,0)}$).

For any polynomial map $g \in \poly(\Z_\N \to G_\N)$, we define the \emph{$i^{th}$ horizontal Taylor coefficient} $\Taylor_i(g) \in \Horiz_i(G)$ to be the quantity
$$ \Taylor_i(g) := \partial_{1} \ldots \partial_{1} g(n) \mod G_{(i,2)}$$

If $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of $G$, we define
$$ \Horiz_i(G/\Gamma) := \Horiz_i(G) / \Horiz_i(\Gamma)$$

    _i( g Œì ) := _i(g) _i(Œì)

for any g ‚àà(_‚Üí G_); it is easy to see that this quantity is well-defined.

These concepts extend to the ultralimit setting in the obvious manner; thus for instance, if ‚àà(H_‚Üí (G/Œì)_), then _i() is an element to _i(G/Œì)."

  Let $k$ be a positive integer, let $G$ be a graph, and let $v_1,\dots,v_k\in V(G)$ be distinct vertices.
  The \emph{WL-tree unfolding at $(v_1,\dots,v_k)$} is the tree-decomposed graph~$(F,T)$ that is constructed together with a bag-wise isomorphic homomorphism~$\pi$ from~$(F,T)$ to~$G$ as follows:

      We start with $F$ having~$k$ vertices~$1,\dots,k$ and~$T$ being the trivial tree

      V(T)$.
      Let $\pi: V(F)\to \set{v_1,\dots,v_k}$ be the function with $\pi(i)=v_i$ for $i\in\set{1,\dots,k}$.
      Let the edges of $F$ be chosen such that $\pi$ is an isomorphism from $F$ to~$G[\set{v_1,\dots,v_k}]$.
    \item\textit{(Introduce nodes)}
      If $t$ is a leaf node of~$T$ with $\abs{\beta(t)}=k$, then for each $w\in V(G)$ with~$w\not\in \pi(\beta(t))$, we do the following:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item
          Add a fresh child node~$t_w$ to~$t$ in~$T$.
        \item

        \item
          Let the bag of~$t_w$ be defined via
          $\beta(t_w)=\beta(t)\cup\set{f}$.
        \item
          Add edges between~$f$ and~$\beta(t)$ to~$F$ in the unique way so that~$\pi$ is an isomorphism from~$F[\beta(t_w)]$ to~$G[\pi(\beta(t_w))]$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item\textit{(Forget nodes)}
      If $t$ is a leaf node of~$T$ with $\abs{\beta(t)}=k+1$, then for each $j\in\set{1,\dots,k}$, we do the following:

        \item

Rotation maps,"\label{def:rotation_map}
The rotation
$$\tausqc: [m] \longrightarrow [m]$$
is the map on the positions in the word $\Qc$ defined as follows. If $q_i=s$, then $\tausqc(i)$ is defined as the position in $\Qc$ of the next occurrence of $s$ if possible, and as the first occurrence of $\wo s \wo$ otherwise.

Using the bijection $\posToRootsc$ from the positions in the word $\Qc$ to almost positive roots, this rotation can also be regarded as a map from almost positive roots to almost positive roots. For simplicity, we abuse of notation and also write
$$\tauc: \Phi_{\geq-1} \longrightarrow \Phi_{\geq-1}$$
for the composition $\posToRootsc  \circ  \tausqc  \circ  \posToRootsc^{-1}$. This composition can be expressed purely in terms of roots as 
$$ 
\tauc (\alpha) =

	c_1\cdots c_{i-1} ( \alpha_{c_i}) &\text{ if } \alpha = -\alpha_{c_i}, \\
	-\alpha_{c_i} &\text{ if } \alpha = c_n\cdots c_{i+1} (\alpha_{c_i}), \\
	c (\alpha) &\text{ otherwise.} \\
\end{cases}
$$

\noindent
The first and the third lines of this equation are given by the root corresponding to the next occurrence of the letter associated to $\alpha$ in $\Qc$. The second line corresponds to the case when the letter associated to $\alpha$ in $\Qc$ is the last occurrence of this letter in $\Qc$. This case can be easily explained as follows. Let~$\eta :S\rightarrow S$ be the involution~$\eta(s)=\wo s \wo$. 
The last occurrence of $\eta(c_i)$ in $\Qc$ is the position which is mapped under $\tauc$ to the first occurrence of $c_i$ in $\Qc$. In other words, if we denote by $\alpha$ the root associated to the last occurrence of $\eta(c_i)$ in $\Qc$, then $\tauc(\alpha)=-\alpha_{c_i}$. In addition, the word $\woc$ is, up to commutations, equal to a word with suffix $(\eta(c_1),\dots,\eta(c_n))$~\cite[Proposition~7.1]{CeballosLabbeStump}. From this we conclude that~$\alpha=c_n\cdots c_{i+1} (\alpha_{c_i})$ as desired.
%\[\alpha=(\wo \eta(c_n)\cdots \eta(c_{i+1}))(\wo(\alpha_{c_i}))=c_n\cdots c_{i+1} (\alpha_{c_i})\]

Consider the cluster variables expressed in terms of the initial cluster seed~$X_c$ associated to the weighted quiver~$\weightedQuiverc$ (recall that this quiver is by definition the Coxeter graph of the Coxeter system~$(W,S)$ directed according to the order of appearance of the simple reflections in~$c$). If~$y$ is the cluster variable at vertex~$i$ of a quiver obtained from~$\weightedQuiverc$ after a sequence of mutations~$\mu_{i_1}\rightarrow \dots \rightarrow \mu_{i_r}$, then the rotation~$\tau(y)$ is the cluster variable at vertex~$i$ of the quiver obtained from~$\weightedQuiverc$ after the sequence of mutations~$\mu_{c_1}\rightarrow \dots \rightarrow \mu_{c_n} \rightarrow \mu_{i_1}\rightarrow \dots \rightarrow \mu_{i_r}$.
